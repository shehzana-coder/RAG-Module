Namal University at a Glance 
Background 
The Namal University, a brainchild project of visionary Mr. Imran Khan is located at 30 
km from Mianwali city on Talagang Road, on a beautiful countryside at the foot of the 
rising hills of Salt Range overseeing the scenic Namal Lake on its east. 
The Namal University started its journey in 2008 as the Diploma Awarding Vocational 
College offering three years Diploma in Network Administration and Software 
Development. However, on the strong demand of the students, Mr. Imran Khan decided 
to affiliate this College to the University of Bradford (UoB) of which he was the Chancellor 
at that time. The courses that were completed by the students for their diploma work, 
were accepted by the UoB and after passing the additional courses during the additional 
top-up year, the first batch of students in Namal were awarded the degree of B.Sc. 
Computing from the UoB in 2012. Subsequently the students admitted in Namal in 2009 
earned their degrees of B.Sc Software Engineering and BEng Computer Science from UoB 
in 2013.  
From 2010 on-wards till 2015 the Namal College was affiliated with UoB for B.Sc 
Computer Science and BEng Electrical & Electronic Engineering and the students have 
completed their respective degrees in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 & 2019.  
From 2016 to 2018, Namal College was affiliated with the University of Engineering and 
Technology (UET), Lahore for the three-degree programmes namely; B.Sc. Computer 
Science, B.Sc. Electrical Engineering and Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA). The 
degrees for the sessions 2016-20, 2017-21 and 2018-22 have been awarded by the UET, 
Lahore. 
In 2019, the College was awarded the status of the degree awarding Institute that was 
further raised to the status of university in 2021.  
Apart from undergraduate teaching, the University has launched two research Centres, 
namely Nisar Aziz AgriTech Research Centre and Namal Centre for Artificial Intelligence 
and Big data. Namal University and two multidisciplinary research centres have paved 
the way for establishing Pakistan’s First Knowledge City in the rural area on the lines of 
Oxford University of UK. 
Namal Knowledge City: An Inspiration, A Dream 
The inspiration that led to the foundation of Namal College in 2008 was sparked by the 
admiration that Imran Khan has with Pakistani youth. To him the future stakeholders of 
Pakistan are a kaleidoscope of talent and hard work and it is with them that hope for a 
brighter future resides. It is a dream that has actualized with the help of his associates 
who are associated with world class institutions like LUMS, SKMT and Descon 
Engineering. This ambitious project was undertaken to provide educational facilities of 
international standards to talented youth of rural areas to trigger social and economic 
change through the academic evolution of rural areas of Pakistan.

Office of the Controller of Examinations (CoE) 
With the advent of the Namal College as the first private 
sector institution of higher professional learning, it was 
affiliated with the University of Bradford (UoB), UK. Hence to 
implement the academic requirements of the UoB at the 
Namal College and coordinate for conducting the UoB 
Examinations at Namal, an Exam and Partnership office was 
established at the beginning of the College. 
However, after the Namal University got its Degree Awarding 
Status through the Act of the Punjab Provincial Assembly in 
2019, a separate and independent Office of the Controller of 
Examination has been established. It has two major 
components; Exams and Partnership Office (EPO) looking 
after the affairs of students registered with the universities (UoB for batches from 2010 to 
2015. 
and UET, Lahore for batches from 2016 to 2018). Since Fall 2019, the students are being 
regulated under the Namal Academic Regulations framed for undergraduate Degree 
Programmes. Two of 0ur batches (Class of 2023 & Class of 2024) have successfully 
graduated from Namal University. The office has introduced the QR Codes for the self-
verification of the academic documents. The main objectives of the office include: 
 Establishing the authenticity of information disseminated from this office 
 Ensure the safe custody of master record pertaining to Exams 
 Execution of exam related functions efficiently within the prescribed time 
Functions and Responsibilities 
 To plan and conduct all Examinations according to the approved Academic Regulations. 
 To maintain secrecy in handling the question papers, answer sheets and tabulation of 
the examination results. 
 To issue Result Notifications after each Exam and Gazette Notifications of Graduates.

of the authorities any infringement of the Regulations pertaining to the examination 
and ensure that the decision of the BoG and other competent authority communicated 
are given effect.

Academic Regulations 
Academic Year 
Namal University's academic year comprises two regular semesters, the Fall and Spring 
semesters. Each semester consists of 18 weeks, comprising 16 teaching weeks, one week 
each for mid-term and final exams. 
The summer semester is optional and spread over 9 weeks, comprising 8 teaching weeks 
and one exam week. To make up for the short duration, the contact hours per week of 
summer semester courses are double of the contact hours of regular semester courses. 
Academic Calendar 
The University will publish an academic calendar well before the start of the Fall semester 
of every year. The calendar may include dates of various events occurring during the 
subsequent academic year (two regular semesters, Fall & Spring, and an optional Summer 
Semester, if required) and must include the following: 
i) 
Semester Starting Date 
ii) 
Holidays During the Semester 
iii) 
Mid-Term Exam Week 
iv) 
Final Exam Week 
v) 
Semester End Date 
vi) 
Result Notification Date 
Special makeup classes shall be arranged, if the university is closed due to unusual 
circumstances and holidays. 
Degree Program 
Program Duration 
The minimum duration of an undergraduate program is four years. A student can, 
however, remain enrolled in any of these programs for a maximum of six consecutive years 
from the date of first admission to Namal University. An extension of up to one year may 
be granted with the Rector's approval as per the academic program's requirement. All 
undergraduate degree programs are comprised of 124(min)-140(max) credit hours in line 
with HEC/NQF (National Qualification Framework) and respective regulatory bodies.  
Course Requirement 
The structure of the undergraduate programs consists of the following course distribution: 
 
i) 
University Core: Compulsory courses for all programs and applicable to all 
undergraduate students of Namal University.
61 | P a g e  
 
ii) 
Program Core: Compulsory courses as specified by the respective program 
curricula. 
 
iii) 
Electives: Optional courses for each program as specified by the respective 
program curricula.  
The relevant academic department will enforce a minimum number of credit hours from 
each category listed above, as per the approved degree requirements. The program core 
and electives may further be sub-categorized as per the requirement of that program by 
the respective department.  
Credit Hours 
i) 
A credit hour means teaching a theory course for one hour each week 
throughout the semester.  
 
ii) 
One credit hour in a laboratory or practical work/project would require lab 
contact of three hours per week throughout the semester. 
 
iii) 
The credit hours are denoted by two digits within brackets with a hyphen in 
between the total being shown prior to the bracket. The first digit represents 
the theory part, while the second (right side) digit represents the practical. 
 
iv) 
 Thus 3(3-0) means three credit hours of theory, while 4(3-1) means a total of 
four credit hours, of which three are of theory while one credit hour is for 
laboratory or practical work/field work as per the requirement of the 
academic program. 
Theory Course of 03 Credit Hours 
3 classes of 01 hour per week or 
2 classes of 1.5 hours per week or 
1 class of 03 hours per week 
Practical (Lab) Work/Field Work 
of  
01 Credit Hour 
03 Contact hours per week 
Course Load 
The maximum load that a student can register in a semester is 18 credit hours. If the 
student follows the regular registration plan as prescribed in the curriculum, he/she will 
be able to complete the graduation requirements within 8 semesters without the need to 
register beyond the maximum load in any semester.  However, in case the student repeats 
a course or takes any extra course(s), it is the responsibility of the student to develop an 
effective plan to complete the graduation requirements.  
 
If a student wishes to enrol in any extra credit hour(s) beyond the maximum limit of 18 
credit hours, he/she can do so with the approval of the Registrar on the recommendation 
of relevant Head of Department (HoD). Such approval can be sought for a maximum of one 
extra course only (beyond the road map) or 22 credit hours, and this exception may only 
be granted if
62 | P a g e  
 
i) 
The student has a CGPA of at least 3.50, or 
ii) 
The student needs to register the course in order to graduate on time.  
The summer semester is optional and the maximum load that a student may register is up 
to 8 credit hours spread over a maximum of two courses. 
Course Registration 
Pre-requisite Courses 
Prior to the enrolment in a course, the program curriculum may require the student to 
have passed a pre-requisite course. This condition is checked at the time of registration for 
the subsequent course. If the pre-requisite and subsequent courses are taken in 
consecutive semesters, then it is possible that the result of the pre-requisite course has 
not been announced when the course registration of the subsequent course is taking 
place. In such an event, the student will be provisionally registered for the subsequent 
course, subject to the condition that the student passes the pre-requisite course. If the 
pre-requisite course is not passed, the student will automatically be dropped from the 
subsequent course. 
Core Courses 
Before the start of each semester, all students will be pre-registered for University Core 
and Program Core courses according to the schedule prescribed in their respective 
curricula, within the specified pre-requisite constraints. 
Elective Courses 
Before the end of the enrolment deadline i.e. two weeks after the start of the semester, 
the students must decide the electives in which they wish to enroll. The department shall 
publish the course outlines for all courses offered in a semester before the semester 
commences. The outlines include the content of the course along with information on pre-
requisite courses, tentative grading breakup, enrolment capacity and any additional 
attendance requirements for the course. The students must communicate the selected 
electives to the department in accordance with the procedure specified by the Registrar. 
A student may be awarded a degree without passing an elective course, provided he/she 
has fulfilled the credit hour requirements of the program. However, that course will not 
be counted towards the credit hour requirements as specified in the program curriculum. 
The curriculum will define the alternative elective course(s) that may be taken in lieu of 
the failed course, in order to complete the credit hour requirements.  
Failed Courses 
A student can only be awarded a degree after passing all the courses belonging to the 
University Core and Program Core categories. Therefore, if a student fails a Core course,
63 | P a g e  
 
he/she must repeat and pass the course as a graduation requirement. The following rules 
apply:  
i) 
If an “F” grade is awarded in a Core course, the student must then repeat the 
course by enrolling in the next offering of that course in a regular semester. 
 
ii) 
The student may also repeat a Core course if offered in the next summer 
semester, provided that it has not been offered in any regular semester after 
the award of the “F” grade. 
Repeating a Course 
A student is allowed to repeat a course in which he/she has obtained a grade “C” or less. 
In this case, the grades of all attempts are included in the transcript, but only the highest 
grade is used in the calculation of CGPA.  
Courses lying outside the Prescribed Curriculum Schedule 
Such enrolment may occur if a student is repeating that course or was unable to enroll in 
that course during its regular offering for some reason (such as not meeting the pre-
requisite criteria or any other unavoidable circumstances). In this case, the student must 
request the department for enrolment in that course at least one week before the 
commencement of the semester, in accordance with the procedure specified by the 
Registrar. An exception to this deadline can only be made if the enrolment is subject to the 
grade of a course whose result is still pending. In such an event, the student must 
communicate the enrolment within 3 working days after the result has been announced. 
Note: A pre-requisite and subsequent course cannot be registered in the same 
semester.   
Course Drop Deadline 
A student may request to drop any course before the drop deadline i.e. two weeks after 
the start of the semester. For this, the student must communicate the request to the 
department in accordance with the procedure specified by the Registrar.  
Course Withdrawal Deadline and Grade Letter for Such Courses 
A student may withdraw from a course voluntarily. If the withdrawal is made before the 
withdrawal deadline, i.e., 6 weeks from the start of the semester, then the student will be 
awarded a “W” grade which will have no impact on the calculation of the GPA. In this case, 
the transcript will reflect the W grade to indicate that the student withdrew from the 
course voluntarily. If the course is withdrawn after the withdrawal deadline then the 
student is automatically awarded an F grade, which will stay on the transcript and will be 
counted in the GPA calculation.
64 | P a g e  
 
Courses Offered in Summer Semester 
i) If a student wishes to enrol in any course offered in the summer semester, 
he/she must communicate the request at least one week before the start of 
the semester. If the student subsequently wishes to drop a course, the deadline 
will be one week after the start of the semester. 
 
ii) A student can only register in 1-2 courses of 3-8 credit hours, and there shall be 
no registration of advance/new courses. Due to the short summer semester 
duration, the enrolment process deadlines are adjusted accordingly. 
 
iii) A student who has either failed a subject or wants to improve his/her grade 
from C (or less), the maximum grade award will be capped at B+. 
Attendance Policy 
Students are expected to attend all classes. However, 75% attendance of the 
lectures/laboratory work delivered to his/her class in each course is mandatory. The Rector 
may give relaxation up to 10% due to unforeseen situations like sickness, bereavement in 
the family, law and order situation, untoward incident etc. on the recommendation of the 
relevant HoD. 
Attendance, once marked, shall not be changed. The student falling short of the required 
attendance percentage in any subject(s) shall not be allowed to appear in the end-
term/final examination of the respective subject(s). Some instructors may have additional 
attendance requirements and can associate grade reduction with absences as specified in 
the course outline.  
Separation Due to Prolonged Absence from Campus 
A student may be separated from the program if he/she is absent from the campus for an 
extended duration of time without any prior notification. Such duration constitutes at least 
4 weeks from the last known presence of the student on campus. The decision of 
separation will be communicated at the provided contact/address. However, the student 
may appeal against the decision within 10 working days to the Rector of the University, 
whose decision will be final.  
Special Hardship Circumstances 
Under extraneous circumstances lying outside of the student’s control, a leave of absence 
without any prior communication may be sanctioned by the University. The authority to 
warrant such a leave lies only with the Rector of the University. 
Freezing of Semester 
A student may take a semester off by applying to the University as per the procedure 
specified by the Registrar. The request to freeze a semester must be made before (or
65 | P a g e  
 
within) two weeks after the commencement of that semester. Further, freezing the first 
semester after admission to the academic program is not allowed.  
  
i) 
An exception to the above may be considered by the Rector for freezing of 
a semester under the following special circumstances: 
 
a) Death in the immediate family 
b) Any other acceptable justified rationale. 
 
ii) 
Summer semester is optional. The request to freeze a semester is only 
applicable to regular semesters. 
 
iii) 
Freezing a semester may cause a delay in graduation. It is the responsibility 
of the student to plan his/her studies accordingly. 
 
iv) 
The maximum allowed duration for completion of the degree requirements 
is calculated from the date of admission to the program and is not affected 
by the freezing of any semester. 
 
v) 
A student's academic/probationary status remains unchanged on re-joining 
the University after taking the semester off. 
 
vi) 
The student must inform the University through the prescribed procedure 
to freeze the semester. Not enrolling in any course or dropping all courses 
for a semester without prior notification does not imply that the student 
has taken the semester off. In such an event, the student will be considered 
absent from the campus with all corresponding rules and regulations 
applied.  
Transfer of Credit Hours 
After admission, a student may request for transfer of credit for course(s) studied at any 
other HEI/university duly recognized by the HEC and respective council/regulatory body. 
Credit hours for all transferred courses will count towards the degree requirements; 
however, they will not be included in the calculation of CGPA at Namal University. The 
following rules apply: 
i) 
A student must earn at least half of the total credit hours of the respective 
program at Namal University in order to be awarded an undergraduate 
degree. This limit will dictate the maximum number of courses whose credit 
hours may be transferred. In addition, the institution that the student has 
previously attended may also enforce some additional requirements 
regarding the limit. 
 
ii) 
Credit hours of a course shall not be transferred if the grade obtained is less 
than C. 
 
iii) 
A course can only be transferred if it is determined to be equivalent to a 
similar course offered at Namal University.
66 | P a g e  
 
iv) 
Like all other students, the transfer student will also be given a maximum 
duration (counted from the start of the degree program in the previous 
institution) for completion of the degree requirements at Namal University. 
The transfer of credit hours can only be approved by the Rector of the University on the 
recommendation of the relevant standing committee of the department in which 
admission is sought. The committee will decide which courses will be transferred, the 
maximum degree duration to be assigned, and any additional/remedial courses to be 
taken. The equivalence of courses will be assessed based on the details provided by the 
HEI where the courses were taken. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that the 
previous HEI provides all the necessary details required for the transfer by Namal 
University. 
Ownership of Work 
Any academic document, such as thesis, research article, project etc. developed by any 
faculty member, student or employee of the University shall be the University's intellectual 
property. 
Mid-term and Final-term Exams 
i. 
Mid-term and final-term exams are scheduled to be held in each semester as 
per the academic calendar under the overall supervision of the Examination 
Office. 
 
ii. 
The date sheet will be issued by the Exam Office for both (mid/final) exams 
along with the allocation of examination venues. The invigilation staff and 
administrative support for the smooth conduct of examinations will be 
deputed/assigned by the office of the Controller of Examinations. 
Eligibility for End-Term Examinations 
A student shall be eligible to appear in the end-term examinations provided he/she: 
i) 
Has been on the rolls of the University during that semester. 
ii) 
Has attained the attendance as per University rules. The student falling 
short of the required percentage of attendance shall be treated as failed 
in that course. 
iii) 
Has registered himself/herself for the courses of study. 
iv) 
Has paid all the university dues including tuition fee/hostel fee etc. before 
the commencement of examinations. 
v) 
If the student is awarded a WF grade by the Disciplinary Committee, the 
student may still appear in the exam if a decision on his/her appeal is 
pending, or the appeal has been registered but formal proceedings not 
yet initiated by the Appeal Committee. In this case, if the original decision 
is upheld by the Appeal Committee, the WF grade will be awarded 
irrespective of whether the final exam was attempted or not.
67 | P a g e  
 
Handicapped/Disabled Students Examination Facilities 
A blind student will be provided writer/amanuensis at the expense of the University on the 
recommendations of the head of the teaching department. The writer/amanuensis shall 
be of a lower grade of education than the candidate. He/she would be allowed 45 minutes 
for solving the question paper over and above the time stipulated for a question paper. 
Evaluation Procedure 
The evaluation of the students is carried out for all the registered courses. The result of 
this process is a letter grade that is awarded against each course. The award of grades will 
take place as follows: 
i) 
The course teacher is responsible for the evaluation of the work/performance 
of the students and for the award of grades on the basis of Table: 2 given in 
section 12.2. 
 
ii) 
The number and nature of tests and assignments depends on the nature of the 
course. To pass a course, a student must obtain a minimum 'D' grade cumulative. 
 
iii) 
The scripts of each activity such as Midterm and Final Examinations, 
assignments, quizzes etc. will be shown to the students by the relevant teacher. 
Grading Instruments 
i) 
The students’ learning in a specific course will be evaluated through various 
grading instruments prescribed and approved by the respective department in 
line with the University approved policy. In each semester, students may be 
required to appear in quizzes, midterm, final examinations, group discussions, 
presentations (individual/group), CEP and submit projects/assignments/lab 
reports. The weightage of these instruments can be determined/assigned on the 
basis of the following guidelines:

*  Each department shall approve the grading instruments along with 
their respective weightage for all the offered courses and intimate to 
the exam office at least one week before the commencement of the 
semester.  
 
ii) 
At the beginning of a semester, the instructor of each course shall hand out the 
information on the attendance policy, grade distribution policy, assessment 
criteria, paper specification, examination dates, schedule of material to be 
taught, take-home assignment policy, reading material and any other 
information important for the successful completion of the course, to the 
students. 
 
iii) 
There will be no Supplementary/Special Examination; if a student fails a course, 
he/she is required to repeat it as per the Course Repeat Policy.  
Grading Policy 
The relative grading system in line with the HEC guidelines will be followed. After the 
conclusion of a course, the instructor awards each student enrolled in that course with a 
letter grade based on the student's performance in the graded instruments. Grades are 
assigned in accordance with the following scale:

F (Fail):  Grade does not count towards the credit hour requirements of the 
program 
*2 
P (Pass): Grade does not count towards GPA calculation. However, it may count 
towards the credit hour requirements as prescribed in the program 
requirements 
*3 
IP (In Progress): The subjects spread over more than one semester may be 
graded as "IP" until completion of those subjects. This grade shall be recorded 
in the transcript and will not be treated as "F" grade. “IP” credits will be counted 
towards degree credit requirements, but these credits will not be used in 
computation of GPA/CGPA.  
*4 
W (Withdrawn): The grade indicates that the student voluntarily withdrew the 
course within the Drop deadline. This grade does not contribute towards the 
student's GPA or credit hour requirements. 
*5  
WF (Withdrawn forcefully): grade indicates that the student was withdrawn 
forcefully from the course due to any disciplinary action. This grade does not 
contribute towards the GPA or credit hour requirements of the student. 
Award of Letter Grades 
The guidelines for the award of letter grades on a relative scale are given below: 
i) 
The final marks (out of 100 and in whole numbers) of each student of the 
class should be used to calculate an arithmetic average and standard 
deviation. 
 
ii) 
Minimum marks threshold linked to content mastery may be established 
for the award of a passing letter grade. Students earning marks below this 
threshold shall be awarded "F" grade 
 
iii) 
The distribution of the marks may be examined by plotting the scatter chart 
or the histogram with appropriate bin widths; with marks plotted on the x-
axis starting from minimum passing marks up to 100 and frequency 
(number of students in various bins on the y-axis). 
 
iv) 
The marks distribution of a standard course is expected to be a bell-shaped 
graph with mean peaked at grade B (mean + 0.5 of SD) and spreading on 
both sides symmetrically depending on the S.D of the marks of the student. 
 
v) 
Letter grades are awarded based on a normal curve, with A+ being the 
highest passing grade (at or beyond +2SD from the mean) and D & D+ being 
the lowest passing grade (at or beyond -2SD from the mean). The other 
grades e.g. B+ lie between (0.5 to 1.0) of SD, A- between (1.0 to 1.5) of SD 
and A between (1.5 to 2.0) of SD. Similarly, B- grade lies between -0.5 to -
1.0) of SD, C+ between (-0.1 to -1.33) of SD, C between (-1.66 to (-1.34) of 
SD, C- between (-1.67 to -2.0) of SD.
70 | P a g e  
 
The instructor may fix a threshold for passing a course with the approval of 
the department. Below this threshold, students are declared as Failed and 
are not included for assigning grades as described above. 
 
vi) 
A teacher may, with the approval of the department, assign B+ or B- (instead 
of B grade) to the mean/peak (depending upon the result data and course 
difficulty level). 
 
Grading Policy for class size of less than 20 students 
For the class size of less than 20 students, Absolute Grading System (AGS) shall be adopted. 
The grades and the grade points against the percentage of obtained marks of each student 
are shown in the Table 3 below.

Result Submission 
The following steps shall be followed in result submission: 
 
i) 
The department shall submit the results of all the offered courses within 
five working days after last day of the final examinations to the office of 
Controller of Examinations.  
ii) 
The Examination Office shall declare the result, within five working days 
after receiving the final award lists.
71 | P a g e  
 
Calculation of Semester GPA  
The Exam Office shall compute the semester Grade Point Average (GPA) of the student at 
the end of each semester. The GPA is a weighted average of the Grade Points earned by 
the student in all the courses of that semester and is calculated as follows: 
GPA = ∑ (grade point × course credits) / ∑ gradable credits 
where the sum is calculated over all the courses taken during that semester 
Calculation of CGPA  
The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is also calculated by the Exam Office at the 
end of each semester and represents the performance of the student combined overall 
completed semesters. The formula for the calculation of CGPA is the same as that for the 
GPA except that the sums are calculated over all courses enrolled by that student since the 
commencement of the program.  
Rechecking of Paper 
i) There shall be no re-evaluation of the answer book. However, a student may apply 
to get the answer book re-checked for totalling and for verification that all questions 
or parts thereof have been fully marked. If applied by the student, this will be done 
by the relevant teacher in presence of Head of the department and the Controller of 
Examinations, within one month from the date of declaration of the result. Errors or 
omissions, if any, shall be rectified. 
 
ii) The candidate or anybody on his behalf has no right to see or examine the answer 
book for any purpose. 
GPA Calculation for Repeated Courses 
In case a student repeats a course, the grade of both attempts will appear on the 
transcript but for CGPA calculation only the highest grade will be counted. 
Student Grievances against Course Instructor 
A student must submit the grievance (if any), against the course instructor in writing to the 
Head of the Department within 5 days of the receipt of the grade. The Head of the 
Department will forward the grievance application to a Committee comprising of three 
senior faculty members. It will be mandatory for the Committee to hear both parties 
(student and the instructor) and will give its final decision within 5 days or before the start 
of registration for the new semester, whichever comes early. The decision of the 
Committee will be deemed final and will be binding on all parties. 
Make-Up Policy for Graded Instruments 
In case, a student has missed midterm or final exam of a course(s), he/she may file a Make-
up Petition within five working days after the exam. The Rector may allow the Make-up 
exam(s) on the recommendation of the relevant Head and the Registrar. If the petition is
72 | P a g e  
 
accepted, the decision will be communicated to all the relevant faculty member(s) to take 
the necessary remedial action. 
Academic Deficiency 
In order to remain in a respectable academic standing, the students are required to 
maintain a minimum standard for their GPA/CGPA in each semester. Failure to do so, will 
result in the student being awarded an academically deficient status according to the rules 
given below 
Academic Warning 
An academic warning indicates that the student must devote further effort towards 
his/her studies to avoid losing his/her satisfactory academic standing. A warning is issued 
if any of the following holds: 
i) 
The student secures a GPA of less than 2.30 in any semester. 
ii) 
The CGPA of the student falls below 2.50 after any semester, regardless of 
the semester GPA. 
In case an academic warning is issued, the student will be notified about the warning via 
email.  
Academic Probation and Separation from the Program 
Academic probation indicates a serious academic deficiency and puts into question 
the ability of the student to continue studying in the program. An academic probation 
can also be applied without the student previously being issued an academic 
warning. 
If the student's CGPA falls below 2.00 (regardless of semester GPA), it will be 
considered as academic probation. If the probation count reaches “3” in his/her 
entire degree program, the student will be separated from the program (For 
example, the student got first probation, CGPA<2.00 in 2nd semester, and later in 4th 
semester same student again secured CGPA <2.00. Later on, at any stage of the 
degree program, if the CGPA (of the same student) falls below 2.00, he/she will be 
separated from the program). 
 
After the student is separated from an academic program, the student will be 
notified about the separation via email, and a separate letter will be dispatched at 
the address of the student provided by the him at the time of admission. 
During academic probation  
i) 
A student may not register more than 12 credit hours for a semester. An 
exception to this may be approved by the Registrar on recommendation of 
the relevant HoD, if this condition is causing the student from graduating 
within the maximum duration for an undergraduate program.
73 | P a g e  
 
ii) 
The student is also not allowed to hold an executive role in a student society 
or any other student body. Failure to comply with this condition may result in 
disciplinary proceedings against the student.  
 
Applying for Admission 
In the case that a student is separated from the program on academic grounds, he/she 
may apply for admission to the program as a fresh candidate as per the admission policy 
of the respective year. However, students separated from the program on disciplinary 
grounds are not eligible to apply for admission as fresh candidate.

activities and plans of the Societies and Clubs. He is the focal person who conveys plans, 
concerns and suggestions to the offices of Registrar and Rector.  Proper representation 
minimizes the gaps and flaws in the execution of the planned activities.
