Mathematical modeling, development and synthesis of tapered transmission line resonators and filters
05-Dec-2024
Tapered transmission line resonators can be used to achieve specific frequency responses and enhance the performance of microwave devices and impedance transformers. To develop a mathematical model (transfer function) of such a wideband resonator will facilitate the construction of an equivalent circuit and the synthesis of resonators of this type. This study discusses the system modeling of tapered transmission line (TTL) resonators using the singularity expansion method (SEM).

A Novel Convolutional Neural Network-Based Approach for Fault Classification in Photovoltaic Arrays
28-Feb-2020
Fault diagnosis in photovoltaic (PV) arrays is essential in enhancing power output as well as the useful life span of a PV system. Severe faults such as Partial Shading (PS) and high impedance faults, low location mismatch, and the presence of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) make fault detection challenging in harsh environmental conditions. In this regard, there have been several attempts made by various researchers to identify PV array faults. However, most of the previous work has focused on fault detection and classification in only a few faulty scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes deep two-dimensional (2-D) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from 2-D scalograms generated from PV system data in order to effectively detect and classify PV system faults. An in-depth quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach is presented and compared with previous classification methods for PV array faults – both classical machine learning based and deep learning based. Unlike contemporary work, five different faulty cases (including faults in PS – on which no work has been done before in the machine learning domain) have been considered in our study, along with the incorporation of MPPT. We generate a consistent dataset over which to compare ours and previous approaches, to make for the first (to the best of our knowledge) comprehensive and meaningful comparative evaluation of fault diagnosis. It is observed that the proposed method involving fine-tuned pre-trained CNN outperforms existing techniques, achieving a high fault detection accuracy of 73.53%. Our study also highlights the importance of representative and discriminative features to classify faults (as opposed to the use of raw data), especially in the noisy scenario, where our method achieves the best performance of 70.45%. We believe that our work will serve to guide future research in PV system fault diagnosis.

Chairman's Message
If we are to have a balanced society, people must be provided with equal opportunities to grow and prosper in life. Availability of quality higher education creates such opportunities. If we make higher education available and affordable for our talented youth, it will lay the foundation for a vibrant and growing society enabling us to stand amongst the leading nations. Namal University Mianwali is exactly that kind of equal opportunity for the marginalized rural youth. I am under no illusion that it is a huge challenge to set up a center of excellence in such a remote location. It will require huge amount of funds to make it a university of international standards.
I want to see more than half of the students in the university coming from less privileged backgrounds benefiting through scholarships, who, in our present elitist education system, cannot dream of having access to high quality education. With a diverse student body, majority of them being supported through financial assistance, increasing number of PhD faculty members and encouraging response from the employers of our graduates, Namal University is moving rapidly towards our vision of becoming a centre of academic excellence in the region for rural development. Success of this Namal University is the first milestone in our eventual goal of creating the largest Knowledge City of Pakistan in Namal.
The establishment of Namal Knowledge City brings the vision of a sustainable Pakistan one step closer. Under the multidisciplinary Namal Knowledge City, students will become tomorrow’s leaders.
Imran Khan

Unveiling temporal patterns in information for improved rumor detection
13-Mar-2025
Rumor detection is a critical task for addressing the spread of misinformation and maintaining the credibility of information sources. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been employed to propose efficient and effective methods for rumor detection. In the wake of the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, the world has faced extensive strain on health, economics, and social structures. The dissemination of false or inaccurate information on social media, whether intentionally malicious or unintentional, has had detrimental consequences for individuals and society, particularly during critical situations like real world emergencies. In this study, we aim to explore the textual and temporal features present in social media posts (specifically tweets) related to COVID-19 to detect rumors as time is unique feature of text and any event can be mapped on timeline. Previous studies utilized the textual features and the temporal features are neglected at large for rumors detection. We utilize both temporal and textual features independently, as well as in combination, to train machine learning and neural network models. The evaluation of multiple algorithms (RNN, LSTM, CNN, DNN, BERT) across various feature sets reveals diverse performance. RNN and LSTM improve with combined textual and temporal features, highlighting temporal information’s importance. CNN performs well with textual features but declines with temporal features. DNN maintains consistent performance, while BERT demonstrates moderate effectiveness in classification tasks.
A Novel Temporal Footprints-Based Framework
for Fake News Detection
30-Oct-2024
With the evolution of social media platforms, the detection of fake news and misinformation
is gaining popularity. Social media platforms are the fastest source of fake news propagation, whereas
online news websites contribute to dissemination. In recent studies, the temporal features in text documents
have gained valuable consideration from the natural language processing (NLP) research community. This
study investigates the importance of temporal features in text documents for detecting fake news. Later, the
temporal features are combined with the textual features to increase classifier performance. This research
study uses Random Forest (RF) and Bi-LSTM techniques to classify fake news based on temporal features
and textual features. A publicly available dataset was used to train and test the model. The experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved 99% accuracy by combining temporal and textual
features in fake news detection
A Hybrid Deep Learning Based Fake News Detection System Using Temporal Features
10-Jun-2024
Detecting fake news and missing information is gaining popularity, especially after social media and online news platforms advancements. Social media is the main and speediest source of fake news propagation, whereas online news websites contribute to fake news dissipation. In this study, we propose a framework to detect fake news using the temporal features of text and consider user feedback to determine whether the news is fake or not. In recent studies, the temporal features in text documents gain valuable consideration from Natural Language Processing and user feedback and only try to classify the textual data as fake or true. This research article indicates the impact of recurring and non-recurring events on fake and true news. We use different models such as LSTM, BERT, and CNN-BiLSTM to investigate, and it is concluded that from BERT, we get better results, and 70% of true news is recurring, and the rest of 30% is non-recurring.
Preventing 51% Attack By Using Consecutive Block Limits In Bitcoin
05-Mar-2024
In permissionless blockchain systems, Proof of Work (PoW) is utilized to address the issues of double-spending and transaction starvation. When an attacker acquires more than 50% of the hash power of the entire network, they gain the ability to engage in double-spending activities, posing a significant threat to the PoW consensus algorithm. This research focuses on the consensus algorithm employed in the Bitcoin system, explaining how it operates and the security challenges it faces. The proposed modification to the PoW algorithm imposes a restriction on miners: they are not allowed to accept consecutive blocks from the same miner into the final local blockchain to prevent the 51% attack problem. This modification supports transactions that require six confirmations. In the event an attacker attempts a 51% attack with a private chain that consists of fewer than 6 blocks, it becomes easier to detect a double-spending attack before accepting the attacker’s private chain. The modified algorithm introduces a “Safe Mode Detection Algorithm” that scrutinizes incoming blocks for adjustments at the top of the local blockchain. If inconsistencies are identified, the consensus algorithm proceeds cautiously by comparing the UTXO dictionaries from the attacker’s chain with those from the miner’s own blockchain. This meticulous comparison aims to detect instances of double-spending. If such instances are detected, the miner rejects the attacker’s chain, establishing a double-spend-free environment and thwarting 51% attacks.
Event-Dataset: Temporal information retrieval and text classification dataset
18-Aug-2019
Recently, Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) has grabbed the major attention of the information retrieval community. TIR exploits the temporal dynamics in the information retrieval process and harnesses both textual relevance and temporal relevance to fulfill the temporal information requirements of a user Ur Rehman Khan et al., 2018. The focus time of document is an important temporal aspect which is defined as the time to which the content of the document refers Jatowt et al., 2015; Jatowt et al., 2013; Morbidoni et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2018. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any standard benchmark data set (publicly available) that holds the potential to comprehensively evaluate the performance of focus time assessment strategies. Considering these aspects, we have produced the Event-dataset, which is comprised of 35 queries and set of news articles for each query. Such that,  where C represents the dataset, is query set and for each  there is a set of news articles 
are sets of relevant documents and non-relevant documents respectively. Each query in the dataset represents a popular event. To annotate these articles into relevant and non-relevant, we have employed a user-study based evaluation method wherein a group of postgraduate students manually annotate the articles into the aforementioned categories. We believe that the generation of such dataset can provide an opportunity for the information retrieval researchers to use it as a benchmark to evaluate focus time assessment methods specifically and information retrieval methods generically.
Section-based focus time estimation of news articles
23-Nov-2018
Information retrieval systems embed temporal information for retrieving the news documents related to temporal queries. One of the important aspects of a news document is the focus time , a time to which the content of document refers. The contemporary state-of-the-art does not exploit focus time to retrieve relevant news document. This paper investigates the inverted pyramid news paradigm to determine the focus time of news documents by extracting temporal expressions, normalizing their value and assigning them a score on the basis of their position in the text. In this method, the news documents are first divided into three sections following the inverted pyramid news paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of four methods for splitting news document into sections: the paragraph-based method, the words-based method, the sentence-based method, and the semantic-based method (SeBM). Temporal expressions in each section are assigned weights using a linear regression model. Finally, a scoring function is used to calculate a temporal score for each time expression appearing in the document. These temporal expressions are then ranked on the basis of their temporal score, where the most suitable expression appears on top. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a diverse dataset of news related to popular events; the results revealed that the proposed splitting methods achieved an average error of less than 5.6 years, whereas the SeBM achieved a high precision score of 0.35 and 0.77 at positions 1 and 2, respectively.
Temporal specificity-based text classification for information retrieval
26-Jun-2018
Time is an important aspect in temporal information retrieval (TIR), a subfield of information retrieval (IR). Web search engines like Google or Bing are common examples of IR systems. An important constituent of a search engine is news retrieval, where users present their information needs in the form of temporal queries. Users are usually interested in news documents focusing on a particular time period. Existing search engines rarely fulfill the temporal information requirements as they ignore the temporal information available in the content of news documents, also known as document focus time. Furthermore, information related to multiple time periods in a news document makes the identification of document focus time a challenging task. Therefore, it is necessary to classify news documents based on temporal specificity before it is possible to use the temporal information in the retrieval process. In this study, we formulate the temporal specificity problem as a time-based classification task by classifying news documents into three temporal classes, ie high temporal specificity, medium temporal specificity, and low temporal specificity. For such classification, rule-based and temporal specificity score (TSS)-based classification approaches are proposed. In the former approach, news documents are classified using a defined set of rules that are based on temporal features. The later approach classifies news documents based on a TSS score using the temporal features. The results of the proposed techniques are compared with four machine learning classification algorithms: Bayes net, support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree. The …
Comparative analysis of information retrieval models on Quran dataset in cross-language information retrieval systems
15-Nov-2011
English is an international language used for communication worldwide but still many cannot read, write, understand, or communicate in English. On the other hand, the World Wide Web has unlimited resources of information in different languages which English native find challenging to understand. To avoid such barriers, Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems are proposed, which refers to document retrieval tasks across different languages. This work focuses on the performance evaluation of different Information Retrieval (IR) models in CLIR system using Quran dataset. Furthermore, this work also investigated the length of query and query expansion models for effective retrieval. The results show that different length of queries has an impact on the performance of the retrieval methods in terms of effectiveness. Hence, after comprehensive experiments, an appropriate length of query for Arabic CLIR system is suggested along with the best query expansion and retrieval model.

Office of the Controller of Examinations (CoE)
With the advent of the Namal College as the first private sector institution of higherprofessional learning, it was affiliated with the University of Bradford (UoB), UK. Hence to implement the academic requirements of the UoB at the Namal College and coordinate for conducting the UoB Examinations at Namal, an Exam and Partnership office was established at the beginning of the College.
However, after the Namal University got its Degree Awarding Status through the Act of the Punjab Provincial Assembly in 2019, a separate and independent Office of the Controller of Examination has been established. It has two major components; Exams and Partnership Office (EPO) looking after the affairs of students registered with the universities (UoB for batches from 2010 to 2015.
and UET, Lahore for batches from 2016 to 2018). Since Fall 2019, the students are being regulated under the Namal Academic Regulations framed for undergraduate Degree Programmes. Two of 0ur batches (Class of 2023 & Class of 2024) have successfully graduated from Namal University. The office has introduced the QR Codes for the self-verification of the academic documents. The main objectives of the office include:
Establishing the authenticity of information disseminated from this office
Ensure the safe custody of master record pertaining to Exams
Execution of exam related functions efficiently within the prescribed time
Dr.Khawar Khurshid
Controller of Examinations (Acting)

To issue Result Notifications after each Exam and Gazette Notifications of Graduates.

To provide adequate information on all examination matters and to bring to the notice of the authorities any infringement of the Regulations pertaining to the examination and ensure that the decision of the BoG and other competent authority communicated are given effect.

Embracing the metaverse: cultivating sustainable tourism growth on a global scale
13-Aug-2024
This paper addresses this gap by exploring the metaverse’s potential to advance sustainable practices in tourism, aligning with sustainable development goals (SDGs). By integrating three behavioural theories – the Theory of Planned Behavior, Technology Acceptance Model, and Self-Determination Theory – this research provides a comprehensive framework to assess the impact of metaverse tourism on sustainability and identify the most relevant SDGs.
Conceptualization and validation of customer participation in health care: a study on chronic illnesses management
19-Jun-2024
Contrary to want-based services, customer participation has got lesser attention in high-credence services like health care. Customer participation for patients with chronic illnesses could be life-threatening and goes beyond the service organization’s physical environment. Realizing the importance of transformative service research in health-care services, this study aims to propose and validate the conceptualization of customer participation for patients with chronic illnesses.  The findings reveal that health-care customer participation is a three-dimensional behavioral construct in which a customer can participate by sharing information, involving in decision-making and ensuring compliance. The study also demonstrates that customer participation is a critical driver of satisfaction with life and perceived control on illness.
Advancing customer experience through service design in mega shopping malls
18-Jan-2024
This research aims to conceptualize and validate the mall service design as a multidimensional construct and then test a conceptual framework by investigating the impact of mall service design on customer mall experience and its subsequent outcomes, that is, intention to revisit and desire to stay in mega shopping malls.
Ethical decision-making in purchasing channels: A context of developing B2B markets
01-May-2023
The present study analyses the responses of supply chain professionals facing certain ethical situations while performing their strategic tasks. The objective of this empirical investigation is to link the six dimensions of moral intensity (magnitude of consequences, proximity, probability of effect, social consensus, temporal immediacy, and concertation of effect) and two dimensions of ethical ideology (idealism and relativism) with three sequential phases of EDM (Ethical Decision Making), i.e. recognition, judgement, and intention, while purchasers are exposed to ethical dilemmas in B2B context. A mixed experimental research methodology was employed to analyse the responses of 289 purchasing professionals from a developing country. Six dimensions of moral intensity were manipulated into three conditions (Low, High, and Control) using 18 originally constructed purchase scenarios. The study’s findings reveal that idealism, relativism, and moral intensity are associated mainly with ethical decision-making stages. Among four sets of ethical ideologies, absolutists were found to be more ethical. The study concludes by giving future research directions and implications for practitioners.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and feature importance-based dimension reduction for Reference Evapotranspiration (ET
) predictions of Taif, Saudi Arabia
02-Jul-2024
Reference Evapotranspiration (ET
) is fundamental to irrigation water management but challenging to calculate due to requirements of many weather parameters for standard Penman–Monteith (PM) method of Reference Evapotranspiration (ET
) calculation. Many machine-learning approaches were proposed for the simplification of Reference Evapotranspiration (ET
) predictions. There is also a need to explore the possibilities of daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET
) predictions for the desert climate of Taif, Saudi Arabia. The study proposed machine learning-based daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET
) predictions of Taif, Saudi Arabia. The weather data of Taif, from 2001 to 2023 is used to train and evaluate the performance of the Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoostR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine Regressor (LightGBMR) based machine learning models. The LightGBMR model outperformed other models for daily Reference Evapotranspiration (ET
) predictions of Taif, with a coefficient of determination (R
) of 0.998, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.016 mm day−1, a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.128 mm day−1, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.093 mm day−1, using twelve weather parameters. The feature importance of the LightGBMR model shows that weather parameters for ET
 predictions of Taif are important in order of wind speed (u
), maximum temperature (T
), relative humidity (R
), solar radiation (R
), extraterrestrial radiations (R
), saturation vapor pressure (
), actual vapor pressure (e
), minimum temperature (T
), net long-wave radiation (R
), number of possible sunshine hours (N), net radiations (R
), and number of actual sunshine hours (n). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the top five weather parameters can capture 99.6% variance for ET
 predictions of Taif. The LightGBMR model trained with top five weather parameters performed equally well as the LightGBMR model trained with all weather parameters, with a R
 of 0.998, a MSE of 0.016 mm day−1, a RMSE of 0.128 mm day−1, and MAE of 0.094 mm day−1. The study provides valuable insights for using appropriate weather parameters for the Reference Evapotranspiration (ET
) predictions of Taif, Saudi Arabia.

A Survey of Deep Learning Techniques for the Analysis of COVID-19 and their usability for Detecting Omicron
13-Feb-2022
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019 has become an ongoing threat to humans worldwide, creating a health crisis that infected millions of lives, as well as devastating the global economy. Deep learning (DL) techniques have proved helpful in analysis and delineation of infectious regions in radiological images in a timely manner. This paper makes an in-depth survey of DL techniques and draws a taxonomy based on diagnostic strategies and learning approaches. DL techniques are systematically categorized into classification, segmentation, and multi-stage approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis at image and region level analysis. Each category includes pre-trained and custom-made Convolutional Neural Network architectures for detecting COVID-19 infection in radiographic imaging modalities; X-Ray, and Computer Tomography (CT). Furthermore, a discussion is made on challenges in developing diagnostic techniques in pandemic, cross-platform interoperability, and examining imaging modality, in addition to reviewing methodologies and performance measures used in these techniques. This survey provides an insight into promising areas of research in DL for analyzing radiographic images and thus, may further accelerate the research in designing of customized DL based diagnostic tools for effectively dealing with new variants of COVID-19 and emerging challenges.

Adaptive Auditory Feedback: A New Method for Desktop Assistance of the Visual Impaired People
09-Oct-2018
This paper presents a new technique of adaptive auditory feedback in desktop assistance for the people with visual impairment.
Adaptive auditory feedback is based on switching between speech only and non-speech only (i.e., Spearcons) sounds. The auditory
feedback adaptively changes that changing based on user mode.
Active users are assigned with speech only while the engaged users with the non-speech only auditory feedback. Ten participants
perform tasks on desktop computers using within-subject design. The proposed adaptive auditory feedback is more efficient in
comparison to speech only and non-speech auditory feedbacks.
It can also improve a user experience in the desktop environment. Finally, it may help dierent researchers to use adaptive auditory
feedback as a substitute for speech only or non-speech auditory feedback during the designing of accessibility software, tools, and
systems.

A Day of Discovery, Dialogue, and Opportunity!
On May 24, 2025, Namal University proudly hosted its 11th Open House and 2nd Career Fair, a dynamic convergence of talent, innovation, and industry.

Rector's Message
Welcome to the Namal University!
Namal University, part of the envisioned Namal Knowledge City, is designed to integrate education with employability to enable talented youth to become economically useful and socially robust citizens of Pakistan. Namal University sits on a total of 1,000 acres in Pakistan’s Salt Range in an area comprising of hills and crags overlooking Namal Lake. This area has a high level of biodiversity and is home to several wildlife sanctuaries. The scenic beauty of Namal University is spellbinding.
Namal is home to a well-knitted and vibrant community of students, faculty, and staff. A strong value system, based on merit, integrity, tolerance, excellence, commitment & social responsibility is integrated to become a center of excellence. Our student body is diverse with respect to gender, region, socio-economic and educational background. Our faculty is a group of dedicated scholars and teachers whose research expands the boundaries of our knowledge and imagination, and whose teachings prepare students for wide-ranging careers and lifelong learning. Namal University is working on developing strategic links with both academic institutions and industry to foster a culture of collaboration between industry and academia. Namal University offers four undergraduate programs i.e. Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics and Bachelors in Business Administration. We believe in sustainability and acquiring excellence in each department is our goal.
I thank you for considering the possibility of becoming a part of the Namal family and wish you the best in your endeavors to achieve your dreams.

Modified triple modular redundancy based fault-tolerant three-phase matrix converter design with AI driven diagnostic capabilities
11-Mar-2025
Three-Phase Matrix Converters (TPMCs) are mostly used in various potential applications, including aircraft, wind turbines, and AC drives. These system applications are endangered by severe disruptions due to critical faults in power electronic switches, which can cause whole system shutdowns and component damage. To reduce these risks and ensure reliable operation under faulty conditions, a robust Fault-Tolerant Control System (FTCS) for TPMC is essential. This paper introduces the diagnosed open-circuit switches fault and fault-tolerant control for TPMCs. The Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) unit is recommended for integration with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based FTCS to identify and isolate defective switches. The FDI unit is additionally outfitted with Modified Triple Modular Redundancy (MTMR) to ensure fault tolerance. To prevent system shutdowns and ensure process continuity, this system can detect faulty switches, isolate them, and then replace them with redundant ones. This strategy mitigates the impact of defective components on the system's overall performance by ensuring their prompt identification and repair. The proposed FTCS, together with MTMR and a cutting-edge FDI unit, will significantly improve the reliability. The MATLAB/Simulink results indicate that the proposed system provides 99.9 % reliability and ANN's parallel computations allow the system to offer fast fault detection. Investigations in this domain have demonstrated that the proposed methodology is an effective means of maintaining operational continuity despite the existence of open circuit failures.
Hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Framework for Prosumers Energy Storage Systems in Smart Grids
11-Dec-2024
Modern power systems encompass multiple prosumers, smart grid technologies, and renewable energy resources (RERs). These prosumer-based smart grids are facing the reliability issues that can be mitigated through the adoption of competitive storage technologies. A range of competitive storage technologies have been developed by scientists. However, the systematic selection of best storage technologies is still one of the main challenging research issues in the current literature. To fill this literature gap, this paper proposes a multi-criteria decision framework for energy storage selection in prosumer-based networks. First, a decision-making hierarchy was developed based on the three main criteria including energy flow management for prosumers, technical features, and sustainability. Under these criteria, various sub-criteria were identified. Second, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem was solved for two cases using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) methods separately. Third, a hybrid AHP and PROMETHEE method was proposed for the selection of an efficient storage system for prosumers based smart grid. Finally, a comprehensive outlook has been provided for prosumer energy storage evaluation. Findings revealed several implications for more accurate storage evaluation decision making. For instance, sensitivity analysis reveals that the lithium ion battery (LIB) has the first preference in AHP method, and the lead acid battery (LAB) has the first preference in PROMETHEE method. However, the second preference for AHP method was the LAB, and the second preference for PROMETHEE method was the LIB. Hence, separate application AHP and PROMETHEE offered a slightly different ranking. According to the proposed hybrid procedure, LIB was ranked as the first option by both AHP and PROMETHEE methods. As a result, the hybridization of AHP and PROMETHEE methods offered a more robust and unique solution to the storage selection problem as compared to the individual method. Storage evaluation decision making has several implications for prosumer-based power systems. In future, only a few storage alternatives would not meet the needs of the large scale emerging power systems, such as peer-to-peer networks. In this situation, the rapid and accurate ranking of various competitive storage alternatives would be a challenging problem. This study is valuable because it offers a comprehensive and flexible decision making tool for storage evaluation for prosumer-based smart grids. For instance, the proposed model can be evaluated with addition or removal of criteria and storage alternatives under different situations.
Damping sub-synchronous resonance in DFIG wind farms: An innovative controller utilizing wide-area measurement systems
01-Nov-2023
The use of series shunt compensators along with wind energy in power systems has increased significantly. One of the main disadvantages of wind energy and series compensation is the phenomenon of sub-synchronous amplification. In this paper, a control method with fuzzy system based on wide area measurement systems (WAMS) and considering time delay in order to increase the damping of sub-synchronous oscillations in compensated networks with capacitive compensators and wind turbines. The DFIG type is provided in the GSC converter’s voltage control loop for the system’s stable operation. The simulation results using MATLAB/Simulink software on Modified IEEE First Bench Mark test networks show the effectiveness of the proposed method in damping sub-synchronous oscillations in power systems compensated with series capacitors.
Finite-time convergence of perturbed nonlinear systems using adaptive barrier-function nonsingular sliding mode control with experimental validation
01-Jul-2023
In this study, an adaptive barrier procedure is combined with nonsingular sliding mode control (SMC) technique at the aim of the fast stabilization of nonlinear system with external disturbances. It is verified that the barred function-based control law leads to the fast convergence of state errors to a region near origin. Furthermore, the suggested method eradicates the requirement for the knowledge of upper bounds of exterior perturbations which are frequently required in SMC scheme. The stability analysis confirms fast convergence of the error states to a predetermined region. In order to 
emonstrate the validity of the planned method, a mass-spring system is examined as the case study. Finally, simulation and experimental outcomes on a mass-spring system are given to prove the efficacy and success of the advised methodology.
Barrier function-based adaptive nonsingular terminal sliding mode control technique for a class of disturbed nonlinear systems
01-Mar-2023
In this article, an adaptive non-singular terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC) is designed based on a barrier function for the robust stability of a category of non-linear dynamic systems in the existence of the external disturbances. The planned approach implements a non-singular terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC) to ensure robust performance with finite time convergence and singularity-free dynamics. It also uses Barrier Functions (BFs) as an adaptation approach for the NTSMC to attain the tracking errors’ convergence to a pre-defined neighbourhood of origin, with a controller gain that is not over-estimated and without requiring any knowledge about the upper bounds of disturbances. The Lyapunov-based stability analysis is carried out to confirm the asymptotic convergence of tracking errors to a pre-defined neighbourhood of zero. The effectiveness and performance of the planned approach is illustrated through simulations and experiments.
Robust tracking composite nonlinear feedback controller design for time-delay uncertain systems in the presence of input saturation
07-Sep-2022
In this study, a robust control technique is investigated for the reference tracking of uncertain time-delayed systems in the existence of the actuator saturation. Due to emerging of some control complexities, as well as the input limitations, time-varying delay, uncertainty, and external disturbance, such a tracking goal would be realized through suitable design of the composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) controller. Thus, considering the mentioned limitations, a Lyapunov-based procedure is used to determine the control law. Then, the parameters of the CNF input are derived by using the solution of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. The planned tracking idea is numerically implemented in two uncertain control systems. Some performance characteristics (i.e., the tracking error, boundedness, and transient responses) are compared with similar ones. Accordingly, the simulations illustrate the efficiency of the suggested control procedure over the existing CNF approaches.
A hybrid approach for fault location in power distributed networks: Impedance-based and machine learning technique
01-Sep-2022
Fault location (FL) is one of the challenges in distribution networks. Many impedance-based methods have been developed to address this challenge. However, these impedance-based methods are not yet able to provide a unique answer, and they only can approximate the distance of the fault from the reference point, which creates challenges in systems that have a large number of separate lines. In this paper, using the impedance method, as well as a deep neural network, a new method for FL is suggested, which can provide a unique answer. In this approach, the FL is determined in less than 6 s, and the accuracy of 99 percent. The deep memory neural network is then used to accurately detect the exact fault location between candidate points. This method also identifies the line where the fault occurred. The performed simulations confirm the validity of the proposed method.
Synchronization and Anti-synchronization of Identical 4-D Hyperchaotic Financial System with External Perturbation via Sliding Mode Control Technique
29-Apr-2022
In this article, complete synchronization and antisynchronization in the identical financial chaotic system are presented. The proposed control strategies depend on first-order sliding mode and adaptive integral sliding mode for complete synchronization and antisynchronization of the identical financial chaotic system. In the primary case, the system parameters should be known, and first-order sliding mode control is utilized for synchronization and antisynchronization while in the second case, the system parameters are considered unknown. An adaptive integral sliding mode control strategy is utilized for synchronization and
antisynchronization of the system considering the parameters unknown. The error system is changed into a particular structure containing a nominal part and several unknown terms to utilize the adaptive integral sliding mode control. Then, this error system is stabilized using integral sliding mode control. The stabilizing controller is usually developed based on the nominal part plus the compensator control part. To suppress the high-frequency oscillation (chattering) phenomenon, smooth continuous compensator control can be used rather than conventional discontinuous control. The compensator controller along with the adapted law is derived such that the time derivative of the Lyapunov function becomes strictly negative. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested through computer simulations. +e proposed control strategies are verified for that Identical 4D hyperchaotic financial system to attain complete synchronization and antisynchronization along with the improved performance.
H?-based control of multi-agent systems: Time-delayed signals, unknown leader states and switching graph topologies
28-Apr-2022
The paper investigates a leader-following scheme for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). The network of agents involves time delay, unknown leader’s states, external perturbations, and switching graph topologies. Two distributed protocols, including a consensus protocol and an observer, are utilized to reconstruct the unavailable states of the leader in a network of agents. The H1-based stability conditions for estimation and consensus problems are obtained in the framework of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the LyapunovKrasovskii approach. It is ensured that each agent achieves the leader-following agreement asymptotically. Moreover, the robustness of the control policy concerning a gain perturbation is guaranteed. Simulation results are performed to assess the suggested schemes. It is shown that the suggested approach gives a remarkable accuracy in the consensus problem and leader’s states estimation in the presence of time-varying gain perturbations, time delay, switching topology and disturbances. The H1 and LMIs conditions are well satisfied
, and the error trajectories are well converged to the origin.
Adaptive nonsingular integral-type dynamic terminal sliding mode synchronizer for disturbed nonlinear systems and its application to secure communication systems
19-Apr-2022
This study proposes an adaptive nonsingular integral dynamic terminal sliding mode tracker/synchronizer for disturbed nonlinear systems along with its usage in safe communication systems. The convergence of the closed-loop structure under
unknown uncertainty and disturbances is guaranteed via Lyapunov analysis. Furthermore, a parameter-tuning method is planned to approximate the upper bound of uncertainty and disturbance terms, since this latter is typically unknown in
practice. The proposed approach is used to design a digital secure transmission scheme according to the chaotic systems. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is validated using computer simulations on a benchmark example of chaotic
system. The obtained outcomes clearly confirm the ability of the planned control approach enables to attain the desired tracking/synchronizing performance despite the disturbances. Additionally, when implemented to the data encryption of
a communication system, the proposed control and secure communication techniques enabled the complete and secure retrieval of the original digital sequences.
Prescribed performance attitude stabilization of a rigid body under physical limitations
23-Mar-2022
This study investigates the prescribed performance control problem associated with attitude stabilization of a rigid body, considering angular velocity constraint, actuator faults, and input saturation. The desired performance specifications in transient and steady-state phases including convergence speed,overshoot and steady-state value for attitude variable are also provided. To this end, the prescribed performance control methodology is combined with backstepping-based barrier Lyapunov function so as to develop a controller with simple structure compared to the existing constrained controls. The main idea behind the control design is to remove partial differential and complex function terms to considerably decrease complexity of the proposed controller. Moreover, a hyperbolic tangent function and an auxiliary system are employed to develop the constrained virtual rotation velocity control and to consider input saturation. The simulation results carried out on a rigid spacecraft confirm efficiency and success of the proposed constrained attitude control method.
A Low-Complexity PD-Like Attitude Control for Spacecraft With Full-State Constraints
14-Mar-2022
The problem of attitude control for rigid spacecraft under the attitude and angular velocity constraints is investigated in this study. Particularly, a simple structure constrained proportional-derivative
(PD)-like control is proposed which contains two portions. The first portion is a conventional PD control to provide convergence of the system states; whereas the second portion provides the desired performance specifications such as convergence rate, overshoot and steady-state bound for attitude and rotation velocity to improve the attitude pointing accuracy and pointing stability.
A simple structure-constrained attitude control for rigid bodies: A PD-type control
18-Jan-2022
This study investigates the challenging and complicated issue of full-state constraint attitude control for rigid bodies under actuators physical limitation. Using the concept of prescribed performance
control (PPC), a novel proportional-derivative (PD)-type control is introduced by which both the attitude quaternion and the rotation velocity of the rigid body are enforced to possess specific behaviors in transient
and steady state. To this end, a prescribed performance function (PPF) with finite-time convergence is first defined as the predefined boundaries for the quaternion and rotation velocity. Subsequently, a constrained
PD-type attitude control for rigid body attitude system is developed. The significant difference between the proposed methodology and the PPC is the simple structure of the controller making it more applicable
from practical implementation point of view. Indeed, due to the use of error transformation in the PPC, the controller contains partial derivative terms and complicated functions even for only constraining the
attitude quaternion. When it comes to angular velocity constraint as well, the complexity of the control design procedure is doubled. It is rigorously proved that the suggested control framework can successfully satisfy
constraints not only on the quaternion but also on the angular velocity, simultaneously. These interesting results are obtained even when the actuator saturation is considered. The simulation results conducted on a
rigid spacecraft verify the efficacy and applicability of the suggested constrained attitude control approach.
Optimized Type-2 Fuzzy Frequency Control for Multi-Area Power Systems
28-Dec-2021
The objective of this study is minimizing the frequency deviation due to the load variations and fluctuations of renewable energy resources. In this paper, a new type-2 fuzzy control (T2FLC) approach
is presented for load frequency control (LFC) in power systems with multi-areas, demand response (DR), battery energy storage system (BESS), and wind farms. BESS is used to reduce the frequency deviations caused by wind energy, and DR is utilized to increase network stability due to fast load changes. The suggested T2FLC is online tuned based on the extended Kalman filter to improve the LFC accuracy in coordination of DR, BESS, and wind farms. The system dynamics are unknown, and the system Jacobian is extracted by online modeling with a simple multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN). The designed LFC is evaluated through simulating on 10-machine New England 39-bus test system (NETS-39b) in four scenarios. Simulation results verifies the desired performance, indicating its superiority compared to a classical PI controllers, and type-1 fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). The mean of improvement percentage is about 20%.
A Robust H? Fault Tolerant Controller for Uncertain Systems Described by Linear Fractional Transformation Model
26-Jul-2021
In this article, a robust H1 fault tolerant control law is addressed for a class of the uncertain dynamical systems represented via linear fractional transformation. To this objective, a state-feedback controller law is utilized for achieving the control objective. Thus, a linear matrix inequality based performance condition would be derived to guarantee that the disturbance suppression is accomplished in the uncertain system. Hence, the gains of the robust H1 controller would be suitably determined by checking the feasibility of such a linear matrix inequality problem. The proposed control technique is numerically simulated in two dynamical uncertain systems (i.e., a typical control system and a mechanical robotic arm). Considering the disturbance rejections and transient responses, the results illustrate the efficiency of the recommended robust technique compared with the existing control methods.
Design of a non-singular adaptive integral-type finite time tracking control for nonlinear systems with external disturbances
19-Jul-2021
This paper proposes an adaptive non-singular fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) with integral surface for the finite time tracking control of nonlinear systems with external disturbances. An appropriate parameter-tuning adaptation law is derived to tackle the disturbances. A new fast terminal sliding scheme with self-tuning algorithm is proposed to synthesize the adaptive non-singular fast integral terminal sliding approach. The proposed approach has the following features: 1) It does not require the derivative of the fractional power terms with respect to time, thereby eschewing the singularity problem typically associated with TSMC; 2) It guarantees the existence of the switching phase under exogenous disturbances with unknown bounds; 3) Because of the integral terms in the sliding surface, the power functions are hidden behind the integrator; 4) It ensures chattering-free dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed using both a simulation and an experimental study. The obtained results showed that the FTSM control technique guarantees that when the switching surface is reached, tracking errors converge to zero at a fast convergence rate. Additionally, the integral term offers one extra degree-of-freedom and since the time-derivative of fractional power terms is not needed in the controller, the proposed switching surface provides a comprehensive framework for singularity avoidance.
Optimal Economic Modelling of Hybrid Combined Cooling, Heating, and Energy Storage System Based on Gravitational Search Algorithm-Random Forest Regression
15-May-2021
The hybridization of two or more energy sources into a single power station is one of the widely discussed solutions to address the demand and supply havoc generated by renewable production (wind-solar/photovoltaic (PV), heating power, and cooling power) and its energy storage issues. Hybrid energy sources work based on the complementary existence of renewable sources. The combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) is one of the significant systems and shows a profit from its low environmental impact, high energy efficiency, low economic investment, and sustainability in the industry. *is paper presents an economic model of a microgrid (MG) system containing the CCHP system and energy storage considering the energy coupling and conversion characteristics, the effective characteristics of each microsource, and energy storage unit is proposed. *e random forest regression (RFR) model was optimized by the gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The test results show that the GSA-RFR model improves prediction accuracy and reduces the generalization error. *e detail of the MG network and the energy storage architecture connected to the other renewable energy sources is discussed. *e mathematical formulation of energy coupling and energy flow of the MG network including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV), CCHP system, fuel cell, and energy storage devices (batteries, cold storage, hot water tanks, and so on) are presented. The testing system has been analysed under load peak cutting and valley filling of energy utilization index, energy utilization rate, the heat pump, the natural gas consumption of the microgas turbine, and the energy storage unit. *e energy efficiency costs were observed as 88.2% and 86.9% with heat pump and energy storage operation comparing with GSA-RFR-based operation costs as 93.2% and 93% in summer and winter season, respectively. The simulation results extended the rationality and economy of the proposed model.
Finite-time tracking controller design of perturbed robotic manipulator based on adaptive Second-order sliding mode control method
10-May-2021
This article presents an adaptive finite time second-order sliding mode tracking control scheme for robotic manipulators. A new control law is suggested to force the trajectories of the robot manipulator
to move from all initial conditions to proportional-integral-derivative switching surface in the finite time and stay on it. Moreover, the adaptation law rejects the requirement of knowledge about upper bound of
the external perturbations. It is difficult to exactly determine the upper bound of the perturbations in the practical systems, such as robot manipulators. Unlike the existing methods, the new adaptive finite time
second-order sliding mode tracker for n-link robot manipulators enables accurate tracking control, robust performance and parameter tuning. The suggested approach presents the design of a robust controller such
that the tracking errors of robot manipulator can reach the equilibrium in the finite time. Through the combination of the finite time tracker and disturbance observer, the position tracking purpose of manipulator
joints is accurately performed not only in the nominal environment, but also in the existence of different types of perturbations. The robustness performance and effectiveness of the offered technique are studied in
simulation and experimental results.

)is communique presents the Q-S synchronization of two nonidentical complex nonlinear hyperchaotic systems with unknown parameters. An adaptive controller based on adaptive integral sliding mode control and parameter update laws are designed to
realize the synchronization and parameter identification to a given map vector. )e aforementioned strategy’s employment demands the transformation of a system into a specific structure containing a nominal part and some unknown terms (later on,
these unknown terms will be computed adaptively). An integral sliding mode controller is used to stabilize the error system by designing nominal control accompanied by compensator control. For chattering suppression, a continuous compensator of
smooth nature is used instead of conventional control. )e stability of the proposed algorithm is established in an impressive way, using Lyapunov criteria. A numerical simulation is performed to illustrate the validity of the proposed synchronization scheme.
Adaptive Sliding Mode Based Stabilization Control for the Class of Underactuated Mechanical Systems
08-Feb-2021
This article presents a simple stabilizing control algorithm for a class of underactuated mechanical systems for two degrees of freedom (2DoF). In this respect, the adaptive sliding mode based strategy is proposed for the considered class. The controller, along with the adapted laws, is decided in such a way that the time derivative of a Lyapunov function grows negative.
Adaptive Smooth Super-twisting Sliding Mode Control of Nonlinear Systems with Unmatched Uncertainty
28-Sep-2020
This article presents a novel strategy regarding the stabilization control problem for plants with unmatched uncertainties. The methodology is based on Adaptive Smooth Super Twisting Sliding Mode Control. At first, as an initial step, the plant with unmatched uncertainty is transformed into a plant with matched uncertainty. At the second step, the plant with matched uncertainty is decomposed into a unique framework containing the nominal part and some unknown terms (where these unknown terms are computed adaptively).
Compact CPW-fed super wideband planar
elliptical antenna
01-Sep-2020
A compact co-planar waveguide (CPW) fed planar elliptical antenna has been designed and presented for super wideband (SWB) characteristics. The 
designed antenna has an overall size of 30 × 30 × 1.57 mm3, and it consists of an elliptical patch radiator fed using a modified 50 Ω CPW-fed tapered  icrostrip feed line. By using a semi-ring shaped structure with a tapered feed line, an impedance bandwidth of 180.66% has been observed from 1.27 to 25 GHz with a ratio bandwidth of 19.68:1.
Modeling and Inverse Complex Generalized Synchronization and Parameter Identification of Non-Identical Nonlinear Complex Systems Using Adaptive Integral Sliding Mode Control
03-Mar-2020
This paper presents the Inverse Complex Generalized Synchronization (ICGS) of non-identical nonlinear complex systems with unknown parameters. Using the philosophy of adaptive integral sliding mode control, an adaptive controller and laws regarding parametric upgradation are designed to realize ICGS and parameter identification of two non-identical chaotic complex systems with respect to a given complex map vector. To employ the control, the error system is transformed into a unique structure containing a nominal part and some unknown terms, which are computed adaptively. Then, the error system is stabilized by using integral sliding mode control.
Beveled-shaped super-wideband planar antenna
16-Jul-2018
In this paper, a design of beveled-shaped planar antenna has been presented for super-wideband applications. The proposed antenna consists of a beveled-shaped radiator, a tapered microstrip feed line, a partial ground plane, and two ground planes on the top side of the substrate. The top ground planes are used to match the impedance at lower frequencies and to minimize spurious radiations caused by the feed line. A tapered feed line has been utilized to enhance the overall bandwidth of an antenna. It has been observed from results that a ratio bandwidth of 66.6:1 has been achieved from 0.3 to 20 GHz. Furthermore, the proposed antenna exhibits good radiation characteristics and offers acceptable gain in the entire bandwidth.
Synchronization of 4-D Hyperchaotic Rikitake Dynamo System  Along With Unknown Parameters Via   Adaptive Integral Sliding Mode
26-Mar-2018
An adaptive integral sliding mode control approach is proposed for the synchronization of 4-D identical hyperchaotic Rikitake dynamo system which operates with unknown parameters. The error dynamics are first transformed into a special structure which contains a known nominal part as well as unknown terms. The unknown terms are computed adaptively via an adaptive compensator, and the resulted error dynamics are stabilized asymptotically using integral sliding mode control.
Smooth super-twisting sliding mode control
for the class of underactuated systems
10-Mar-2018
In this article, Smooth Super-twisting Sliding Mode Control (SSTWSMC) is investigated for the class of underactuated system. In underactuated systems, the control design is not directly applicable as for other systems (known as fully actuated systems). Therefore, at initial step, a nonlinear uncertain model of systems is transformed into the controllable canonical form, and then Smooth Super Twisting (SSTW) based Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is devised for the control design purpose for the considered class.
A Comparative Experimental Study of Robust Sliding Mode Control Strategies for Underactuated Systems
12-Jul-2017
This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study for the tracking control of a class of underactuated nonlinear uncertain systems. A given nonlinear model of the underactuated system is, at first stage, transformed into an input output form and the driving applied control input of the transformed system is then designed via four sliding mode control strategies, i.e., conventional first order sliding mode control, second order sliding mode, fast terminal sliding mode, and integral sliding mode.
Robust Control of Underactuated Systems: Higher Order Integral Sliding Mode Approach
12-Jan-2016
This paper presents a robust control design for the class of underactuated uncertain nonlinear systems. Either the nonlinear model of the underactuated systems is transformed into an input output form and then an integral manifold is devised for the control design purpose or an integral manifold is defined directly for the concerned class. Having defined the integral manifolds discontinuous control laws are designed which are capable of maintaining sliding mode from the very beginning. The closed loop stability of these systems is presented in an impressive way. The effectiveness and demand of the designed control laws are verified via the simulation and experimental results of ball and beam system.

Visuo-haptic exploration with relocated haptic feedback: impact of virtual and augmented reality
29-Jul-2025
Rendering haptic feedback on the wrist is an effective solution for freeing users' hands during virtual interactions while still providing haptic feedback, mostly focusing on Virtual Reality (VR) environments. Unfortunately, whether these solutions can be extended to Augmented Reality (AR) interactions has not been investigated before. In this paper, we investigate the perceptual differences between VR and AR environments with a user study experiment based on a stiffness discrimination task. Our findings revealed similar task accuracy and sensitivity in VR and AR but different exploration behaviors (i.e. higher interaction time in AR) and user experience (i.e. higher enjoyment and less mental fatigue in AR).

Enhancing Eye-Hand Coordination in Volleyball Players: A Comparative Analysis of VR, AR, and 2D Display Technologies and Task Instructions
21-Oct-2024
Previous studies analyzed user motor performance with Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Eye-Hand Coordination Training Systems (EHCTSs) while asking participants to follow specific task instructions. Although these studies suggested VR & AR EHCTSs as potential training systems for sports players, they recruited participants for their user studies among general population. In this paper, we examined the training performance of 16 professional volleyball players over 8 days using EHCTSs with three display technologies (VR, AR, and 2D touchscreen) and with four distinct task instructions (prioritizing speed, error rate, accuracy, or none). Our results indicate that volleyball players performed best with 2D touchscreen in terms of time, error rate, accuracy, precision, and throughput. Moreover, their performance was superior when using VR over AR.
Eye-hand coordination training: A systematic comparison of 2D, VR, and AR display technologies and task instructions
16-Mar-2024
evious studies on Eye-Hand Coordination Training (EHCT) focused on the comparison of user motor performance across different hardware with cross-sectional studies. In this paper, we compare user motor performance with an EHCT setup in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and on a 2D touchscreen display in a longitudinal study. Through a ten-day user study, we thoroughly analyzed the motor performance of twenty participants with five task instructions focusing on speed, error rate, accuracy, precision, and none. As a novel evaluation criterion, we also analyzed the participants’ performance in terms of effective throughput. The results showed that each task instruction has a different effect on one or more psychomotor characteristics of the trainee, which highlights the importance of personalized training programs.
Sustainable agriculture: an IoT-based solution for early disease detection in greenhouses
09-Jun-2023
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a cutting-edge paradigm that involves the interconnection of multiple advanced sensors and peripheral devices to enable the automation and orchestration of various complex systems. In the agricultural context, smart devices are utilized to acquire and transmit data from a diverse range of sensors that monitor intricate environmental parameters crucial to ensuring optimal plant growth. These factors encompass but are not limited to humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and water pH. Continuous monitoring and control of these environmental aspects are essential for maximizing plant growth and yield. Manual disease monitoring is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise in plant pathology. To overcome these challenges, convolutional neural network models employing deep learning techniques have been developed to detect and diagnose diseases in plants.
On the effectiveness of virtual eye-hand coordination training with head mounted displays
25-Mar-2023
Eye-hand coordination training systems are used to train participants' motor skills and visual perception. Such systems have already been tested in Virtual Reality, and the results revealed that Head Mounted Display-based systems have the potential to improve the motor training. However, this was only investigated in an hour-long study. In the longitudinal study reported here, we analyzed the motor performance of three participants in ten sessions with three different assessment criteria, where participants were instructed to focus on speed, error rate, or complete the training freely (with no instructions). We also assessed the effective throughput performance of the participants. Our results indicate that effective throughput can be potentially used as an additional assessment criterion. We hope that our results will help practitioners and developers design efficient Virtual Reality training systems.

Parental Prioritization-Based Task Scheduling in Heterogeneous Systems
17-Jan-2019
Efficient task scheduling is important for achieving high performance in heterogeneous distributed computing systems. The main focus of this research is to build a task-scheduling algorithm for a heterogeneous environment. We proposed an algorithm named parental prioritization earliest finish time. It has two phases, task prioritization phase and processor assigning phase. In the tasks prioritization phase, tasks will schedule in the parental priority queue (PPQ) on the basis of downward rank and parental priority. Task prioritization is based on the directed acyclic graph. It can schedule the task of successor row before the current row if it has less communication cost. In the processor assigning phase, the processor will allocate to the scheduled tasks obtained from PPQ keeping the computation cost to a minimum. This proposed algorithm is compared with HEFT and CPOP algorithms through graphs generated from a random task graph generator and a set of tasks. The experimental results show that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs significantly better than other algorithms in terms of both cost and makespan of schedules.

Flexible Genetic Algorithm Operators for Task Scheduling in Cloud Datacenters
29-Jan-2021
Cloud computing is the backbone of the modern information technology industry. Due to the increase in internet usage, social media, and smart phones, a large amount of data is producing. Cloud datacenters can provide resources to handle this data. If data is not properly handled, it can cause overhead on cloud servers and can increase operational costs. Genetic algorithm is used to solve scheduling problem efficiently, but they take a lot of time to find an optimal solution. In this paper, we proposed Flexible Genetic Algorithm Operators (FGAO) for Task Scheduling in Cloud Datacenters. This algorithm changes crossover and mutation operators according to the quality of scheduling solutions. Instead of giving a fixed stopping criteria algorithm uses flexible crossover and mutation operators as a stopping criterion. Experimental results show that the proposed FGAO algorithm reduces 40% execution time and 33% iterations as compared to the genetic algorithm.

Life At Namal
Open House
The Career Development and Placement Center (CDC) at Namal University serves as a vital bridge between academic learning and the professional world, dedicated to guiding students and recent graduates toward successful careers. Through personalized counseling, the CDC assists individuals in exploring internships, enhancing their skills, and pursuing higher education opportunities. By fostering connections between academia and industry, the center ensures that students are well-prepared to meet the demands of the job market.
A key initiative of the CDC is the annual Open House and Career Fair, which brings together over 90 leading organizations to engage with Namal students. This event offers a platform for showcasing final-year projects, participating in on-site interviews, and networking with potential employers. Additionally, the CDC organizes workshops and training sessions focused on essential professional skills such as resume writing and interview techniques, equipping students with the tools needed for career success.
Beyond individual career support, the CDC plays a significant role in community development and social responsibility. Through initiatives like the Time Bank, students contribute to community service projects, gaining practical experience while making a positive impact. This holistic approach not only prepares students for the workforce but also instills a sense of civic duty and leadership, aligning with Namal University's mission to produce graduates who are both professionally competent and socially conscious.

Farewell Party of the Class 2025
Event
Latest From Namal
Farewell Party of the Class 2025
It's always one of the most touching moments for the faculty, management and the junior students to bid farewell to Namal's very own would-be graduates. The class of 2026, as per our tradition, arranged an extraordinary farewell party/dinner for the outgoing class of 2025. The students of third year and the final year students showed an awesome bondage. The management won appreciation for arranging the exceptional and befitting farewell for the class 2025. Excitement was its peak, but each one became emotional because of the inevitability of departure. God bless you, Class 2025!

Guidelines and Policies
Time Bank
Namal’s Time Bank intends to achieve three pillars of change namely sustainability, student development, and social development. This is achieved through social account and work account which all students are required to maintain at the bank. All students of Namal University are require to contribute 320 hours every year towards community service. Examples of community service include collection of waste, tuition services for school going children, plantation drives in the community, etc. Students will need to deposit their hours in the social account. Students who are on scholarships are required to contribute additional hours for on-campus and off- campus jobs. The hours should be deposited in the work account. Maximum of
320 hours per year
are required to be deposited in the work account which will vary depending on the scholarship granted for each student. For example students on 100% scholarship will be required to contribute 320 hours while those on 50% scholarship will be required to contribute
160 hours per year
. Jobs in this category include working on projects related to renewable energy, waste recycling, management of farms (olive orchards, vegetable farms, etc.), and other projects given by partners and Founding Members of Namal. Another way of looking at Time Bank is to understand that students have a maximum of 960 hours which they need to deposit in the bank. These hours can be divided as follows; one-third to be spent on community service, one-third on on-campus and off-campus jobs, and remaining one-third (i.e.320 hours) can be deposited in the Alumni Scholarship Fund in terms of equivalent rupee value after graduation. Contribution in the Alumni Scholarship Fund is not mandatory. Through Time Bank all students are able to learn and polish themselves professionally while learning the six Namal values. The Time Bank also greatly benefits the society at large while creating an atmosphere of sustainability.
Library/ Book Bank
The University library is one of the rapidly growing resources on the campus. More than 12,000 books are available in library covering multiple subject areas including computer science, electrical engineering, literature, history, religion and social sciences. A periodical section is also available in library where more than 35 international journals and transactions are available. The library also provides access to digital resources. Book bank is a section of library where textbooks of all courses are kept and student can borrow those books for whole semester.
12000+ Books
40+ Journals
Guidelines and Policies
Internship and Career Placement
Networking with industry is an important part of the establishment of Career Placement Office. The office, in coordination with Registrar’s office, invites professionals from industry to conduct seminars & workshops on current topics. It also holds an Open House/ Job fair to facilitate the industry and the graduating class for jobs. Students can seek guidance for a range of support areas from preparing their resume to advice on where to circulate their CVs. The faculty is closely involved with the office to maximize the placement of Namal graduates.
Computer Labs
Ten Labs are available for the students with more than 300 computers to practice and improve their skills throughout the day (Analytical Lab, General Lab, FYP Lab, Huawei Lab, System Lab, Simulation Lab, Analog & Digital Electronics Lab, Circuit & Communication Lab, Power Electronics Lab, Physics & Control Lab).

Health Services
Namal University provides healthcare facilities through a part-time doctor and a full-time dispenser. The doctor is available for 5 hours at the campus & for 3 hours in the evening at Chagda hostel, while the dispenser remains on campus during working hours.

Fostering Transformative Collaborations: CFLI and NUST Unite for an Ambitious Venture 
A milestone moment unfolded as Amanda DeSadeleer, 1st Secretary at the High Commission of Canada in Pakistan, visited NUST. The spotlight was on an innovative cold chain solution, a brainchild of SMME, nurtured by CFLI's support.
Standing shoulder to shoulder with this initiative, the local partner, PODA - Pakistan, played a pivotal role. Dr Syed Hussain Imran Jaffery of SMME provided a comprehensive briefing, unveiling the project's intricacies. Three schools of NUST- SMME, SEECS and NBS have joined forces, exemplifying a dynamic partnership for the success of this groundbreaking technology.
The stakeholders are confident about the project's potential to enhance farm productivity and reduce post-harvest wastage.
Classification of Retroviruses Based on Genomic Data Using RVGC
Retroviruses are a large group of infectious agents with similar virion structures and replication mechanisms. AIDS, cancer, neurologic disorders, and other clinical conditions can all be fatal due to retrovirus infections. Detection of retroviruses by genome sequence is a biological problem that benefits from computational methods. The National Center for Biotechnol-ogy Information (NCBI) promotes science and health by making biomedical and genomic data available to the public. This research aims to classify the different types of rotavirus genome sequences available at the NCBI. First, nucleotide pattern occurrences are counted in the given genome sequences at the preprocessing stage. Based on some significant results, the number of features used for classification is reduced to five. The classification shall be carried out in two phases. The first phase of classification shall select only two features. Unclassified data in the first phase is transferred to the next phase, where the final decision is taken with the remaining three features. Three data sets of animals and human retroviruses are selected; the training data set is used to minimize the classifier's number and training; the validation data set is used to validate the models. The performance of the classifier is analyzed using the test data set. Also, we use decision tree, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and vector support machines to compare results. The results show that the proposed approach performs better than the existing methods for the retrovirus's imbalanced genome-sequence dataset.

LightHybridNet-Transformer-FFIA: A hybrid Transformer based deep learning model for enhanced fish feeding intensity classification
05-Aug-2025
Accurate assessment of fish feeding intensity is important for efficient and sustainable aquaculture. This paper introduces LightHybridNet-Transformer-FFIA, a novel and parameter-efficient hybrid neural network for automated fish feeding intensity classification in aquaculture. Addressing the critical need for optimized feed management, our model utilizes the fusion of sonar imagery and Mel spectrograms to accurately assess feeding intensity levels. LightHybridNet-Transformer-FFIA integrates a Convolutional Neural Network branch for spatial feature extraction from sonar images with a Transformer branch for capturing temporal dynamics in Mel spectrograms, fused by a Feature Fusion and Interaction Aggregation (FFIA) module. Evaluated on the MRS-FFIA dataset, our model achieves a high validation accuracy of 95.42% and a macro-averaged F1-score of 95.40%, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-modal models while utilizing a significantly smaller parameter footprint (0.102 million parameters). The architectural novelty and parameter efficiency of LightHybridNet-Transformer-FFIA present a promising solution for real-time aquaculture monitoring, enabling optimized feed delivery, reduced waste, and improved sustainability. This work highlights the effectiveness of hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures for multi-modal underwater sensing and contributes a practically deployable model for intelligent aquaculture management.
EEG electrode setup optimization using feature extraction techniques for neonatal sleep state classification
31-Jan-2025
An optimal arrangement of electrodes during data collection is essential for gaining a deeper understanding of neonatal sleep and assessing cognitive health in order to reduce technical complexity and reduce skin irritation risks. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data, a long-short-term memory (LSTM) classifier categorizes neonatal sleep states. An 16,803 30-second segment was collected from 64 infants between 36 and 43 weeks of age at Fudan University Children's Hospital to train and test the proposed model. To enhance the performance of an LSTM-based classification model, 94 linear and nonlinear features in the time and frequency domains with three novel features (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Lyapunov exponent, and multiscale fluctuation entropy) are extracted. An imbalance between classes is solved using the SMOTE technique. In addition, the most significant features are identified and prioritized using principal component analysis (PCA). In comparison to other single channels, the C3 channel has an accuracy value of 80.75% ± 0.82%, with a kappa value of 0.76. Classification accuracy for four left-side electrodes is higher (82.71% ± 0.88%) than for four right-side electrodes (81.14% ± 0.77%), while kappa values are respectively 0.78 and 0.76. Study results suggest that specific EEG channels play an important role in determining sleep stage classification, as well as suggesting optimal electrode configuration. Moreover, this research can be used to improve neonatal care by monitoring sleep, which can allow early detection of sleep disorders. As a result, this study captures information effectively using a single channel, reducing computing load and maintaining performance at the same time. With the incorporation of time and frequency-domain linear and nonlinear features into sleep staging, newborn sleep dynamics and irregularities can be better understood.
Automated lumpy skin grading in bovine images using novel deep convolutional neural networks
05-Nov-2024
The diagnosis and prevention of lumpy skin disease, a viral ailment affecting cattle and buffalo, present significant financial implications for the livestock industry. Traditional methods for identifying lumpy skin disease rely on manual visual inspection by veterinarians, which can be labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to errors. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model for the automatic recognition and grading of lumpy skin disease from bovine images. The primary contributions of this research include the development of a DCNN architecture specifically tailored for this task, comprising five convolutional layers, five max pooling layers, two fully connected layers with ReLU activation, and a final fully connected layer with softmax activation. The model’s detection accuracy is further enhanced by applying image cropping and patching techniques, which divide each input image into 12 patches to improve local feature extraction. The proposed model was trained and tested using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. Comparative analysis was conducted against several state-of-the-art models, including InceptionV3, ResNet50, MobileNetV3, VGG19, and Xception. The DCNN model demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest validation accuracy of 0.96875, outperforming the compared models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, the study explores the potential of transitioning from binary to multiclass classification, which would allow for the assessment of the severity of lumpy skin disease. This future direction aims to provide more nuanced and actionable information for veterinary diagnostics. The significance of this research lies in its potential to offer an objective, efficient, and scalable solution for early disease detection and prevention in livestock, thereby presenting considerable economic benefits for farmers and the livestock industry as a whole. The methodology, including data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation, is comprehensively detailed to ensure reproducibility and to highlight the robustness of the proposed approach.

05-Jun-2024
Understanding the feeding dynamics of aquatic animals is crucial for aquaculture optimization and ecosystem management. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing fish feeding behavior based on a fusion of spectrogram-extracted features and deep learning architecture. Raw audio waveforms are first transformed into Log Mel Spectrograms, and a fusion of features such as the Discrete Wavelet Transform, the Gabor filter, the Local Binary Pattern, and the Laplacian High Pass Filter, followed by a well-adapted deep model, is proposed to capture crucial spectral and spectral information that can help distinguish between the various forms of fish feeding behavior. The Involutional Neural Network (INN)-based deep learning model is used for classification, achieving an accuracy of up to 97% across various temporal segments. The proposed methodology is shown to be effective in accurately classifying the feeding intensities of Oplegnathus punctatus, enabling insights pertinent to aquaculture enhancement and ecosystem management. Future work may include additional feature extraction modalities and multi-modal data integration to further our understanding and contribute towards the sustainable management of marine resources.

24-Apr-2024
This research introduces a novel dual-pathway convolutional neural network (DP-CNN) architecture tailored for robust performance in Log-Mel spectrogram image analysis derived from raw multichannel electromyography signals. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of the proposed DP-CNN architecture across three datasets (NinaPro DB1, DB2, and DB3), encompassing both able-bodied and amputee subjects. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are employed for comprehensive evaluation. The DP-CNN demonstrates notable mean accuracies of 94.93 ± 1.71% and 94.00 ± 3.65% on NinaPro DB1 and DB2 for healthy subjects, respectively. Additionally, it achieves a robust mean classification accuracy of 85.36 ± 0.82% on amputee subjects in DB3, affirming its efficacy. Comparative analysis with previous methodologies on the same datasets reveals substantial improvements of 28.33%, 26.92%, and 39.09% over the baseline for DB1, DB2, and DB3, respectively. The DP-CNN’s superior performance extends to comparisons with transfer learning models for image classification, reaffirming its efficacy. Across diverse datasets involving both able-bodied and amputee subjects, the DP-CNN exhibits enhanced capabilities, holding promise for advancing myoelectric control.

01-Mar-2024
Thyroid disorders represent a significant global health challenge with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism as two common conditions arising from dysfunction in the thyroid gland. Accurate and timely diagnosis of these disorders is crucial for effective treatment and patient care. This research introduces a comprehensive approach to improve the accuracy of thyroid disorder diagnosis through the integration of ensemble stacking and advanced feature selection techniques. Sequential forward feature selection, sequential backward feature elimination, and bidirectional feature elimination are investigated in this study. In ensemble learning, random forest, adaptive boosting, and bagging classifiers are employed. The effectiveness of these techniques is evaluated using two different datasets obtained from the University of California Irvine-Machine Learning Repository, both of which undergo preprocessing steps, including outlier removal, addressing missing data, data cleansing, and feature reduction. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the remarkable success of proposed ensemble stacking and bidirectional feature elimination achieving 100% and 99.86% accuracy in identifying hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, respectively. Beyond enhancing detection accuracy, the ensemble stacking model also demonstrated a streamlined computational complexity which is pivotal for practical medical applications. It significantly outperformed existing studies with similar objectives underscoring the viability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. This research offers an innovative perspective and sets the platform for improved thyroid disorder diagnosis with broader implications for healthcare and patient well-being.
Efficient thyroid disorder identification with weighted voting ensemble of super learners by using adaptive synthetic sampling technique
14-Aug-2023
There are millions of people suffering from thyroid disease all over the world. For thyroid cancer to be effectively treated and managed, a correct diagnosis is necessary. In this article, we suggest an innovative approach for diagnosing thyroid disease that combines an adaptive synthetic sampling method with weighted average voting (WAV) ensemble of two distinct super learners (SLs). Resampling techniques are used in the suggested methodology to correct the class imbalance in the datasets and a group of two SLs made up of various base estimators and meta-estimators is used to increase the accuracy of thyroid cancer identification. To assess the effectiveness of our suggested methodology, we used two publicly accessible datasets: the KEEL thyroid illness (Dataset1) and the hypothyroid dataset (Dataset2) from the UCI repository. The findings of using the adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) sampling technique in both datasets revealed considerable gains in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The WAV ensemble of the two distinct SLs that were deployed exhibited improved performance when compared to prior existing studies on identical datasets and produced higher prediction accuracy than any individual model alone. The suggested methodology has the potential to increase the accuracy of thyroid cancer categorization and could assist with patient diagnosis and treatment. The WAV ensemble strategy computational complexity and the ideal choice of base estimators in SLs continue to be constraints of this study that call for further investigation.
Efficient energy management for household: Optimization-based integration of distributed energy resources in smart grid
07-Aug-2023
Energy demand is increasing globally due to the growing human population and progressive lifestyle. The adequate use of available energy resources, including renewable, contributes to a country’s economic sustainability and future development. Optimization-based energy management and cost minimization plays a significant role in overcoming energy crises in less developed countries. In this paper, an optimization–based dynamic energy management technique for smart grids is developed based on the integration of available renewable resources and variable consumer demand, distinctive to underdeveloped countries. Consumer demand is classified into fixed, flexible, and highly variable based on population characteristics. In this work, we developed a Dynamic Multiple Knapsack DMKNS algorithm, which automatically schedules energy provision to various users by optimally accounting for the available resources (Grid and Renewable). The proposed method provides a low-cost solution by maintaining a constant energy supply while preserving consumer comfort and grid stability. The simulation results with various intermittent availability of resources using MKNS show a saving up to 50% for a variable energy demand user. The proposed method is general and can also be applied to various underdeveloped regions with similar consumer demand and statistics.
Automated uterine fibroids detection in ultrasound images using deep convolutional neural networks
20-May-2023
Fibroids of the uterus are a common benign tumor affecting women of childbearing age. Uterine fibroids (UF) can be effectively treated with earlier identification and diagnosis. Its automated diagnosis from medical images is an area where deep learning (DL)-based algorithms have demonstrated promising results. In this research, we evaluated state-of-the-art DL architectures VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and our proposed innovative dual-path deep convolutional neural network (DPCNN) architecture for UF detection tasks. Using preprocessing methods including scaling, normalization, and data augmentation, an ultrasound image dataset from Kaggle is prepared for use. After the images are used to train and validate the DL models, the model performance is evaluated using different measures. When compared to existing DL models, our suggested DPCNN architecture achieved the highest accuracy of 99.8 percent. Findings show that pre-trained deep-learning model performance for UF diagnosis from medical images may significantly improve with the application of fine-tuning strategies. In particular, the InceptionV3 model achieved 90% accuracy, with the ResNet50 model achieving 89% accuracy. It should be noted that the VGG16 model was found to have a lower accuracy level of 85%. Our findings show that DL-based methods can be effectively utilized to facilitate automated UF detection from medical images. Further research in this area holds great potential and could lead to the creation of cutting-edge computer-aided diagnosis systems. To further advance the state-of-the-art in medical imaging analysis, the DL community is invited to investigate these lines of research. Although our proposed innovative DPCNN architecture performed best, fine-tuned versions of pre-trained models like InceptionV3 and ResNet50 also delivered strong results. This work lays the foundation for future studies and has the potential to enhance the precision and suitability with which UF is detected.
Enhancing ductal carcinoma classification using transfer learning with 3D U-net models in breast cancer imaging
27-Mar-2023
Breast cancer ranks among the leading causes of death for women globally, making it imperative to swiftly and precisely detect the condition to ensure timely treatment and enhanced chances of recovery. This study focuses on transfer learning with 3D U-Net models to classify ductal carcinoma, the most frequent subtype of breast cancer, in histopathology imaging. In this research work, a dataset of 162 microscopic images of breast cancer specimens is utilized for breast histopathology analysis. Preprocessing the original image data includes shrinking the images, standardizing the intensities, and extracting patches of size 50 × 50 pixels. The retrieved patches were employed to construct a basic 3D U-Net model and a refined 3D U-Net model that had been previously trained on an extensive medical image segmentation dataset. The findings revealed that the fine-tuned 3D U-Net model (97%) outperformed the simple 3D U-Net model (87%) in identifying ductal cancer in breast histopathology imaging. The fine-tuned model exhibited a smaller loss (0.003) on the testing data (0.041) in comparison to the simple model. The disparity in the training and testing accuracy reveals that the fine-tuned model may have overfitted to the training data indicating that there is room for improvement. To progress in computer-aided diagnosis, the research study also adopted various data augmentation methodologies. The experimental approach that was put forward achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the benchmark techniques used in previous studies in the same field, and exhibiting greater accuracy. The presented scheme has promising potential for better cancer detection and diagnosis in practical applications of mammography.
E2CNN: An efficient concatenated cnn for classification of surface emg extracted from upper limb
15-Mar-2023
Surface electromyography is a bioelectrical indicator that emerges during muscle contraction and has been widely used in a variety of clinical applications. Several prosthetic control applications can benefit from the analysis based on the classification of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. However, for the real-time application of upper limb prosthesis, the EMG-based systems need robust performance and rapid response behavior. In this study, we propose an efficient concatenated convolutional neural network (E2CNN) for classification of sEMG extracted from the upper limb. We have tested and validated the performance of the proposed E2CNN on two datasets: a longitudinal dataset comprising ten nondisabled (healthy) subjects and six transradial amputee subjects and spanning the data collected for a period of seven days; and the publicly available NinaPro DB1 dataset. The raw sEMG signals are converted into Log-Mel spectrograms (LMSs). This model combines the input layers with the output of each convolutional block using concatenation layers. The proposed E2CNN when applied to LMS-based images provides a good response time with high-performance accuracy of 98.31% ± 0.5% and 97.97% ± 1.41% for both nondisabled and amputee subjects. When applied to NinaPro DB1, the proposed E2CNN has attained a mean accuracy of 91.27%, an increase by 24.67% with respect to the baseline CNN model. The results show that the achieved results are comparable to those obtained using stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAEs) and other CNN models; however, E2CNN is associated with reduced training and prediction times, making it a potential candidate for real-time classification of sEMG based on LM spectrogram images.

This experimentation has been done after reducing the dimensional space of the used data with extended Kernel Principal Component Analysis (K-PCA). Five different kernels in K-PCA have been tested after the implementation of necessary pre-processing techniques. The performance assessment of the proposed system has been evaluated based on confusion matrix-based accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. Our proposed methodology with six selected feature and sigmoid K-PCA attained the best accuracy of 99.28%. This result outer performs many state-of-the-art studies recently published on the identical dataset.

20-Sep-2022
Physiological signals such as electromyography (EMG) have been used in human–computer interaction (HCI) for medical applications. Wearable prostheses, such as robotic limbs, have seen a surge in popularity because of technological advancements in myoelectric interfaces. In spite of encouraging achievements with pattern-recognition-based control systems, user acceptability of prosthetic hands still needs improvement in control robustness. The purpose of this research is to compare multiday surface EMG (sEMG) recordings and measure the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance myoelectric control. The performance metrics used in this study are accuracy, macro weighted precision (MWP), macro weighted recall (MWR), and macro F1 -score for eight able-bodied (healthy and nondisabled) and four amputee subjects. Using Mel-spectrogram-based sEMG data from both the able-bodied (healthy and nondisabled) and amputee participants, our proposed CNN has achieved a mean classification accuracy of 99.42% ± 0.42% and 98.00% ± 0.58% for the able-bodied (healthy and nondisabled) and amputee subjects for the within-day analysis, respectively. The proposed CNN outperformed other classifiers ( p≤0.05 ) in the between-day analysis for twofold (65.88% ± 10.1% and 58.37% ± 9.11%) and for sevenfold validation (88.73% ± 1.43% and 77.35% ± 2.72%) using sEMG recordings from the able-bodied (healthy and nondisabled) and amputee subjects, respectively. The proposed CNN is compared with the pretrained transfer learning (TL) models and has achieved higher accuracy with lower computational cost. The results demonstrate that CNN can considerably increase the effectiveness of the pattern recognition myoelectric control schemes and can extract deep information from EMG data.
Spectral Processing of Self-Mixing Interferometric Signal Phase for Improved Vibration Sensing under
Weak-and Moderate-Feedback Regime
13-Aug-2019
In this paper, spectral processing of laser Self-Mixing (SM) interferometric signal phase has been carried out allowing better measurement accuracy for harmonic and arbitrarily shaped vibrations for an optical feedback based SM interferometric Laser Diode (LD) sensor. The resulting algorithm not only improves the measurement accuracy but also reduces the processing time (by a factor 3.45) as compared with a previous time-domain based displacement retrieval technique called the Phase Unwrapping Method (PUM). Fourier series based analysis of laser feedback phase is carried out to determine processing limits. The proposed algorithm has also been found to be robust against variation in optical feedback coupling C as well as additive noise. This use of spectral analysis not only increases the measurement accuracy but also retrieves information about target movement harmonics which can also be used in modal analysis applications of remote mechanical targets. Using an SM vibration sensor based on a LD emitting at 785 nm, this technique has provided an average RMS error of 12.5 nm (while that of PUM is 39 nm RMS) for harmonic target vibrations of 5 μm amplitude. For reduced range of 1 <; C <; 2, an average RMS error of ~8 nm (~λ/100) is obtained.

Discrete Wavelet Transform for Laser Diode Self-Mixing Interferometry Processing for Vibrations Measurement
27-Nov-2024
Optical feedback interferometry, known for its efficient resource usage, contrasts traditional two-beam interferometry. Laser diode self-mixing interferometry (SM) is a prevalent remote sensing approach. Despite providing insights into target and laser diode dynamics, noise compromises SM interferometry’s efficacy. Leveraging time-frequency signal processing reduces noise in self-mixing signals. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the processing of self-mixing laser sensor signals, specifically focusing on leveraging the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for enhanced analysis. A Wavelet Transform-based Phase Unwrapping Technique is introduced, surpassing traditional methods like the Fast Fourier Transform, especially in handling non-stationary self-mixing (SM) signals. The technique’s key strength lies in its ability to simultaneously retain frequency and temporal information, effectively addressing challenges associated with dynamic signals. The proposed method ensures precise outcomes for stationary and non-stationary signals, marking a significant advancement in laser sensor signal processing. By harnessing DWT’s capabilities, the approach offers heightened accuracy and versatility, shaping the trajectory of SM signal analysis. Incorporating the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for SMI, our study achieved remarkable accuracy improvements. DWT-based processing resulted in an error of 12.77nm as compared to 60.98nm for RPUM, 5.95nm for FFT for stationary signals, and 11.98nm as compared to 64.64nm for RPUM and 1228nm for FFT for non-stationary signals, marking a significant advancement in laser sensor signal processing. Through this work, we provide a transformative avenue for advancing laser sensor research and elevating signal processing methodologies across disciplines.

30-Oct-2024
This study evaluated the combined effects of biochar and chemical nutrients on soil fertility and mash bean growth in rain-fed areas of Pakistan. Six treatments were tested to assess changes in soil properties, nutrient availability, and nitrogen fixation. Findings provide insights into biochar’s potential to enhance soil health, nutrient retention, and crop productivity in low-fertility soils.
Challenges and opportunities to design future crops: gateway to sustainable agriculture in 21st century
19-May-2024
The global food production system is facing numerous challenges due to factors such as population growth, climate change, limited resources, and environmental preservation. Efficient utilization of agricultural resources is another important aspect of crop improvement. This includes developing crops that use water and nutrients more efficiently, reducing the need for irrigation and fertilizers, and minimizing environmental impacts. Increasing the resistance of crops to pests, diseases, and extreme weather events can also help reduce the use of pesticides and minimize crop losses. Overall, these strategies can help address the challenges faced by the global food production system.

Life At Namal
Student Societies
Introduction
Student Societies help to bring the likeminded people together on one platform, share the same viewpoints and construct new ideas. They not only allow students’ minds to flourish amid the hectic routine studies and frenzied curriculum but also allow them to exhibit their entrepreneurial, leadership and artistic skills along with sports. Keeping in mind all these aspects, Namal University has designed 12 active student societies that directly contribute to the further development of their recreational and vocational skills. Student societies consist of the general body and the executive body. General body consists of the general members. Any student of Namal University has the right to become a member of a society he/she is interested in. Patrons play important role and establish a bridge between executive members and Patron-in-Chief. The office of the Patron-in-Chief plays a pivotal role and monitors all the activities and plans of the Societies and Clubs. He is the focal person who conveys plans, concerns and suggestions to the offices of Registrar and Rector.  Proper representation minimizes the gaps and flaws in the execution of the planned activities.
Eligibility Criteria
for Executive Bodies
A student, who wants to become a member of the executive body of a student society, must fulfil the following conditions:
He/she must be a member of the general body for at least one year.
He/she has not been involved in any disciplinary case throughout his /her Institute life.
Should not be in the executive body of any other society at the same time.
Must not have been suspended/removed from the executive body of any society before.
It is the responsibility of the Patrons of the respective societies and clubs to select their teams purely on merit. He conducts interviews and may get the help of outgoing Presidents to be the party of interview panels for selecting good teams. Patrons should formally announce the slots to all the students.  Interested students will apply and may get selected, if Patrons think that they deserve to be the part of their teams.
Process for Shortlisting the Candidates
In order to shortlist the applicants, who have applied in more than one society, the process of short listing will be done in the presence of all Patrons of the Societies and Clubs. In such a case, the candidate will be considered for a position of only that Society for which he/she has previous relevant work experience and has already performed with full dedication and devotion. His/her previous performance will surely be given good weightage.
Role of the Executive Body

Execute the planned events on time, as mentioned in the Activity Calendar.
Ensure the smooth execution of the events and abide by the Namal University’s values and rules.
Accept all the proposals and ideas on merit from any student of Namal University (whether the student is a member of the society or not).

The student has a right to appeal to the Patron if his/her idea is rejected by the society members.
Drive the membership campaign, especially on Orientation Week of the new batch. They will utilize the given slot effectively to attract as many Freshers as possible.

Mufti Muhammad Shafi Uthmani's Political Thoughts an Exploration through Tafsir Maarif Al-Qur'an
31-Dec-2024
This article endeavors to elucidate the political ideology and perspectives of Mufti Muhammad Shafi Usmani, a prominent figure in the Pakistan Movement and a close associate of Quaid-e-Azam. As a key contributor to the formulation of Pakistan's legislation, particularly the Islamic provisions of the Resolution of Objectives, Mufti Usmani's thoughts on governance offer valuable insights into the intersection of Islam and democracy.

Given his affiliation with a religious institution that advocates for the Caliphate system, this article seeks to explore Mufti Usmani's opinions on the supreme authority of the state, constitutional frameworks, leadership roles, and government positions. Furthermore, it examines his views on the Caliphate and democratic systems, providing a nuanced understanding of his political philosophy.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Mufti Muhammad Shafi Usmani's political thoughts and their relevance to contemporary discussions of Islam, democracy, and governance by critically analyzing his literary works, including Maarif ul Quran.

Impact of High Voltage Transmission Line on Photovoltaic Power Production
In this study, a comprehensive theoretical analysis was presented to show the impact of ac 
electric and magnetic field produced by a high voltage transmission line on power production of a PV 
module. The results of related experimentation and artificial intelligence were given, and it was 
demonstrated the ac electric field produced by high voltage transmission lines has no effect on PV 
power production, while ac magnetic field has negative effect on output power of PV module located 
near high voltage transmission lines
To Improve the Efficiency of Long Distance DC Power Transmission System for
Photovoltaic Power Generation
 Renewable resources specifically photovoltaic power transmission to a long distance 
is studied in this research study.
 Long Distance Transmission System consists of PV array input as 450V-650V.
 Ultra-Lift Luo Converter (ULL) is placed where the voltage will be stepped-up and this 
ULL converter has switching loss so Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) Technique is 
applied to enhance overall efficiency.
 Sensitivity analysis is performed by increase/decrease in PV capacity which shows 
that no change in overall gain of designed ULL converter that make the system more 
reliable

Think Green Save The Enviroment
The vision of building Namal Knowledge City thrives on the very premise of protecting our natural, social and physical environment, particularly that of Namal Valley. The objective is to provide an enabling academic and professional environment to our students to nurture a culture of environment protection that is an essential requirement for prosperous and progressive Pakistan.
The word GREEN symbolizes the colors of paradise while the word Namal (translated ‘anmoal’ in Urdu) means priceless (invaluable) land. The topography, the landscape, the monuments and the cultural history of Namal valley embraces in its fold the very essence of Green Namal philosophy. The natural world is a source of inspiration for its visual beauty that is the basis for life on earth. The Green Namal initiative is meant to motivate all members of the Namal Family to inculcate a sense of responsibility and commitment to become ecologically conscious individuals. We are committed to the notion that a cleaner & greener environment is essential to our future generations to flourish and thrive in healthy environment.
Namal Valley
Namal Valley lies some 30 kilometers away from Mianwali city and is nestled amidst the Koh-i-Suleiman and Salt Range along the border area of Punjub and KPK. The valley has a unique topography and boasts numerous lakes of which Namal is most visible. The valley is also speckled with numerous smaller lakes that stretch up to the valley of Soon Sakesar on the highest point of the Salt Range. The economy is largely agrarian with farming and livestock dominating the economic activity in the area. Namal Valley is also known as a sanctuary for many migrant species of birds and animals that thrive in perfect ecosystem.
namal lake
Namal Lake is the most prominent feature of Namal Valley. It has a surface area of approximately 5 square kilometers and is the largest of the many lakes that are spread across the valley. The surrounding area serves as grazing pastures for animals that the inhabitants of the Valley rear as a source of income. It is an attractive tourist resort as people from across the Namal valley and beyond visit this place as a picnic spot. It also serves as a perfect abode for various species of birds like Russian ducks and Siberian cranes that migrate to this place during winters.
Namal University is erected to its West on a high pedestal in the foothill of a scenic mountaintop. The Student Support Office of Namal University is very active through various student societies to make the best use of this natural gift for recreational, sports and academic activities.
namal dam
The dam was built by the British Government in 1913 to conserve water coming from numerous streams of water that eventually gave shape to what is now Namal Lake. It was aimed at creating a water resource for irrigating vast tracts of barren land to the western side of Mianwali. For over a century the dam has served as a constant source of precious water for the farmers in the area. It also serves as an exciting excursion point for the tourists as Namal Lake winds through the mountains that make it an attractive point for boating across the lake up to the dam.

The Namal Story
The Namal Story
The Namal story began when, in 2005, Imran Khan made the momentous decision to build an academic institution on the banks of the eponymous lake with a vision to empower Pakistan’s youth. Despite early obstacles, Namal College was established in 2008 with the support of the local community and generous donors. The initial 5 acres (40 kanals) of land for this college was provided by Ghulam Muhammad Seelu, a local resident of village Namal. Namal College started its operations with one degree program as an affiliate college of the University of Bradford, UK. In early 2019, Namal was granted degree-awarding status and became Namal Institute.
Over time, the dream to build an educational institute has evolved into one for establishing the largest university town in Pakistan by the name of Namal Knowledge City. A comprehensive plan for establishing six academic buildings, student hostels, faculty apartments, a central library, a mosque, an enterprise center and commercial areas has taken shape. The Knowledge City will house the School of Science and Engineering, School of Medicine, School of Business, School of Humanities, School of Agribusiness and a Technology Park. The Agribusiness School is the second building to be completed in this plan.
Namal University sits on a total of 1000 acres in Pakistan’s Salt Range in an area comprising of hills and crags overlooking Namal Lake in Mianwali District. The Salt Range is a hill system in the Punjab province of Pakistan deriving its name from its extensive deposits of rock salt. This area has a high level of biodiversity and is home to a number of wildlife sanctuaries. Outdoor enthusiasts will find the terrain to be very suited to an eco-progressive lifestyle. From the towering hills on the western side with their hidden sulphur springs, and the Lake to the east with its rocky bank offering stunning sunset views, the rich natural heritage of Namal Valley enhances Namal’s academic experience and offers several opportunities for outdoor activities.

Preparation of ZnO-MWCNTS nanocomposite: structural features and applications for enhanced oil recovery
06-Nov-2019
Since last few decades, the importance of tertiary oil recovery is increasing day by day. Quest for novel hydrophobic materials compatible to oil for enhanced recovery using electromagnetic is the major focus in this field. In the present study, we present ZnO-MWCNT nanocomposite prepared using sol-gel technique for the application of enhanced oil recovery. XRD analysis shows that average particle size in the range of 30-39 nm. Morphology analysis showed that ZnO are coated on the surface of the MWCNT. Vibrational analysis indicated that ZnO-MWCNT nanocomposite exhibited E2 (high) mode of ZnO and G (sp2 carbon) bands of MWCNTs and intense sharp peak of Zn-O stretching bond. A 11.11% of oil recovery was observed using ZnO-MWCNT composite nanofluid. This recovery further enhanced to 16.10% under the effect of electromagnetic field. Therefore, this novel material can be used to enhance oil recovery with application of EM waves. [Received: September 7, 2017; Accepted: March 28, 2018]
MWCNT for ambient urea synthesis
15-Sep-2018
Highlights

• Effect of adsorption of reactant gases on orbital energy states of CNT 
• Effect of strength of magnetic field on the urea yield using CNT nanocatalyst 
• Simultaneous effect of flow rate, magnetic field strength and duration of reaction
. Engtangled MWCNT were synthesized using substrate free floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition technique
. MWCNT synthesized had hematite and magnetite encapsulated inside, two clear XRD peaks show the presence of non aligned CNT
• The maximum urea yield (using optimization) was accomplished by applying 1.25 T of magnetic field and using 0.25 L/min of flow rate for a reaction time of one minute.
• Using lower flow rate and high magnetic field strength improved urea yield.
CO2 Mixture Adsorption at Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube: Effects from Different Gases and Stoichiometric Ratios
01-Jun-2018
Using adsorption locator for the most stable adsorption site searches, the authors investigated adsorption of mixture of gases with different carbon dioxide mole ratio at a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). A total of six mixtures were investigated, two mixtures consist of hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide with compositions 3:1:1 and 3:1:2. Whereas the reaming four mixtures consist of ammonia and carbon dioxide with compositions 5:1, 4:1, 3:1 and 3:2. Results demonstrated that gas interactions with carbon nanotubes increased as the mole ratio of carbon dioxide increased in H2, N2 and CO2 mixture, conversely decreased for NH3 and CO2 mixture. After increasing CO2 mole fraction from 1/5 to 1/3 for hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide mixture, adsorption energy and rate on carbon nanotube atoms increased by 45 and 33%, respectively, due to a 59% increase in van der Waal interactions. The preferred molar ratio of H2, N2 and CO2 mixture for adsorption is 3:1:2. The maximum adsorption energy and rate for NH3 and CO2 mixture is obtained using the 5:1 sample. Adsorption energy for the NH3 and CO2 mixtures increased by 18% when the ratio changed from 3:1 to 3:2 while the adsorption rate decreased considerably.

Interactive use of biochar and chemical fertilizer for improving nutrient availability and crop growth in rainfed area
30-Oct-2024
The major limitations of rain-fed areas in Pakistan include soil fertility loss, reduced soil productivity and water scarcity. To address these challenges, research has investigated the potential use of biochar in low-fertility and degraded soils to increase soil fertility, nutrient uptake, and water retention, ultimately improving soil productivity and crop growth. A field study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of biochar, coupled with chemical nutrient on the availability of soil nutrient and crop growth. The evaluations comprised measurements of CEC of soil, pH levels of soil, soil bulk density, total nitrogen (N), soil phosphorus (P), SOM, soil texture, extractable potassium (K), and total organic carbon (TOC). Nitrogen fixation by mash beans was also evaluated using xylem solute techniques. This study’s results will contribute valuable insights into the impact of biochar on crop growth and soil health in rain-fed regions.

Bal-E-Jabreel's Taghzal: A Research And Critical Review
30-Jun-2023
Allama Iqbal  completely  changed  the  body  of  Ghazal.  Thanks  to  Iqbal,  today Urdu  Ghazal  is  reaching  the  extremes  of  development  and  all  kinds  of  ideas  are being expressed in it.Iqbal's ghazal is not a traditional ghazal. His beloved is the nation  of  Islam,  humanity,  the  prophet  and  the  person  of  Allah  Almighty,  Iqbal makes them beloved and speaks in such a way that a unique isolation is created in his ghazals.Allama was carrying the pain of the nation in his chest, so Bal Jibreel is  also  not  free  from  this  pain, but  here  all  the  ghazals  and  poems  seem  to  be immersed in the pain of the nation.Allama has brought ghazal to its peak in Baal Jibreel  and  has  grasped  all  kinds  of  colorful  subjects  in  such  a  way  that  even  in the  precise  and  heavy  problems  of  philosophy, he  made  them  into  ghazal  by creating  subtlety  and  elegance.  And  this  is  such  a  great  artistic  and  intellectual achievement  that  not  only  Urdu  poetry  but  the  poetry  of  the  whole  world  will continue to be proud of.

THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAS AND THEORIES OF ALLAMA IQBAL AND THE PROBLEMS OF THE PRESENT AGE
31-Mar-2022
Iqbal is the representative of poetry in all the aspects like historical poet, poet of present and modern poet. His suspended poetry communicates about broad vision, wisdom and intellectuals. Iqbal wrote poetry to save the youth and Muslim of sub-continent from destruction, miserable condition, and low mental state of the people. According to Iqbal wrong mental nurturing is gigantic and more serious mistake than the wrong political progress. A nation goes down when a nation ignores aims, culture and civilization, moral and cultural values, and religious ethics. Iqbal says a nation can progress on the basis of "broad vision". Iqbal always compare broad vision and intellectualism in terms of Quran education. It is also a fact only those nations can be destroyed who made the foundation of their thinking, vision, progress and prosperity only on their religion. A nation can't be demolished who remain determined positively on their religious values.
Philosophy of Education In The Light Of Iqbal's Biography, A Historical Analysis
31-Dec-2021
Pakistan is the result of the intellectual imagination of Allama Iqbal. The goal of its achievement was the establishment of an Islamic society according to the requirements of the present day in the light of Iqbal's thought. Unfortunately, since the establishment of Pakistan, we have failed to achieve this goal.

We have reached many milestones of material development. In spite of becoming a nuclear power in terms of defense, establishing educational institutions in places, our crime rate is increasing. Anxiety and restlessness are increasing. People are becoming victims of psychological diseases. The main reason for this is the lack of positive training to a large extent. It is important for us to organize the all-round training of the people of the society by making the thoughts of Iqbal as the basis. This paper is a humble attempt to highlight Iqbal's philosophical training.
Maqam-e-Mustafa in Context of Kal?m-e-Iqbal, An Exploratory Analysis
30-Dec-2021
Allama Muhammad Iqbal was a true lover of Rasool, even though he was a philosopher, he had studied Western philosophy without looking at it and received higher education in the West, but if there is any color on his thoughts, ideas and words, then he is Rasool(S.A.W). It is the color of true love and boundless devotion to God. The summation of Iqbal's poetry is Love of Rasool(S.A.W) and Obedience of Rasool. From the study of Iqbal's speech, this fact is clearly revealed that he considers the Holy Prophet to be the source of all external and internal perfections and the source of all reality and authority. According to Allama Iqbal, love of Prophet (P.B.U.H) is the dear possession without which a person can neither live in the world nor gain anything from religion.
HUMAN MORAL VALUES AND IQBAL THOUGHT
31-Dec-2020
Human higher moral values are the basis of man’s dignity. The moral values greatly affect the numerous economics, social, political and religious aspect of human life. The nations of the word are engulfed in peacelessness, frustration and calmlessness account of moral depravity. Before nations fall into victim of some great calamity, we must have to pay full attention to overcome moral degradation.

Iqbal is the man of universality. He believes in peace and harmony. His thoughts guide us to determine higher human moral values. The need of the hour is to fully utilize the Iqbal’s thoughts. The article in hand is an effort to highlight human moral values and Iqbal thought.
The Unpublished Writings of Zarb-e-Kaleem
01-Jan-2012
The  analysis  of  Iqbal's  mindsetting  is  the  reflection  of  his  own  will.  Wecan  find  art  pieces  of  high  calibre  in  the  exceptioanal  poetic  writings  offirst-rate poet.  It is  very  necessary to  analyze  the whole  writings of  Iqbal.In  view  of  such  importance  the  critics  of  Iqbalism  has  compiled anumber  of  collections  based  on  remain  writings.  In  this  context,  thecompiler's  axis  rem ained  bound  m ostly  on  verses  but  the  lines,generally,  were  neglected.  The  topic  in  hand  includes  those  unpublishedwritings  of  "Zarb-e-Kaleem  "  which  consists  mostly  on  lines.I  hope  thatthrough  this  article,  the  lovers  of  Iqbalism  will  be  familiarized  with  thosehidden links which remained out of sight uptill now.
Baal-e-Jibril: Unpublished and Omitted Verses and Lines of the Ghazals
31-Dec-2011
The analysis of Iqbal's mindset is the reflection of his own will. In view of such importance, the critics of Iqbalism have compiled a number of collections based on remaining writings. In this context, the latest comprehensive book, named "Kuliyat-i- Shier-i-Iqbal", was compiled by Dr. Sabir Hussain Kalorvi. The compiler's axis remained bound mostly on verses, but the lines, generally, were neglected. The topic in hand includes those unpublished writings of "Bal-i-Jibreel", which consists of lines. I hope that through this article, the lovers of Iqbalism will be familiarized with those hidden links which remained out of sight until now.

Livestock Breed Identification using image analysis Technique
This project aims to revolutionize the livestock sector in Pakistan by utilizing the Machine Learning and AI algorithms. In the Agricultural sector in Pakistan, Livestock comprises a major part. Unfortunately, at many levels, multiple animals are considered un-identified because their breed is not recognized properly. For a long time, the animal breeds are recognized manually just by using previous knowledge. DNA imprinting methods that include studying the types of animals by studying their Genome sequence is another popular strategy but is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, a cost-effective and easy-to-use method is required for proper breed recognition. In this project, we are proposing the recognition of the breed of livestock by developing a deep-learning model using the image data. We train our model by providing it with different biometric indicators of different animals. So, our model will be analyzing and identifying the breed of the animal by scanning different features of the animal like coat color, coat pattern, horns, size and length of animal body, etc.

PDF Chat Bot: Document Based Conversations
This research explores the potential of pre-trained open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for using secure and cost-effective in-house chatbot solutions within organizations. Through the utilization of the data-privacy centered PrivateGPT architecture and the capabilities of open source LLMs, we propose a solution that addresses data security and control problems that are frequently connected with commercially available chatbot solutions. The study investigates how businesses may use these open-source tools to create unique chatbots that can be deployed inside their local infrastructure and have access restricted to only authorized individuals. The research attempts to show the feasibility and affordability of this strategy by comparing the development, deployment, and maintenance expenses of this in-house solution to choices provided by third parties. This project promotes the broader use of LLMs in the workplace landscape by offering a safe and affordable substitute for current commercial solutions, hence meeting the growing demand for responsible AI adoption inside enterprises.

Currency Detection System for Blind People
Blind or visually impaired individuals encounter challenges in daily life, including difficulty recognizing currency notes. Despite the growing popularity of electronic payments, cash remains widely used. This reliance on cash poses problems for those with visual impairments, as they struggle to identify currency values during financial transactions, making them vulnerable to exploitation. To assist blind individuals Currency Detection System can be employed. This project will include two parts, firstly training of YOLOv8 model on Pakistani currency notes and a system will be employed. The model will be given with an image of a currency note to detect the currency denomination as output. Furthermore, text-to-speech model will be used to convert text output into speech. This Project will be deployed on Google Cloud using NGROK (cross-platform application) enabling the Flask API to be accessible over the internet. Secondly, it includes research on YOLOv8 and analysis of results obtained by YOLOv8.

LensLook: An AR Customized Solution - Bringing Beauty to Reality
This AR-based cosmetic lens try-on app offers users a personalized and interactive shopping experience, similar to leading beauty brands like L'Oréal and Sephora. Designed for mobile devices, the app allows users to virtually try on cosmetic contact lenses in real time, using augmented reality. By analyzing the user's skin tone through facial landmark detection and skin tone classification (based on 5–7 common Asian skin tones), the app recommends 3–4 lens shades that best complement their complexion. Eye region tracking ensures accurate overlay of virtual lenses on the user's eyes, creating a realistic and immersive try-on experience. The app features a friendly, easy-to-use interface where users can explore recommended lenses or manually browse the collection.

Personality-Based Candidate Recommendation System Using MBTI for Recruitment
The Personality-Based Candidate Recommendation System leverages the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to modernize recruitment by aligning candidates' personalities with job roles. Traditional hiring often overlooks personality-job fit, leading to mismatches and high turnover. This system introduces a dual-interface approach: a candidate-facing MBTI assessment platform and an HR dashboard for compatibility analysis. It replaces manual processes with a secure, scalable digital solution that reduces bias and enhances decision-making. Aimed at transforming recruitment in Pakistan, the system improves efficiency, workforce alignment, and engagement. Future enhancements may include cultural and team fit analytics for deeper organizational impact.

Data Driven Approach to predict crop price and suitable location to sell the crops.
Agriculture plays a vital role in Pakistan’s economy, yet farmers often lack reliable data to make profitable crop-selling decisions. This project analyzes daily price and quantity data (2021–2025) for eight major crops across ten cities in Punjab, sourced from AMIS. We applied data analytics and developed a Random Forest model to predict future prices and suggest the best cities for selling crops. Despite data limitations, the project demonstrates how machine learning can empower farmers and improve decision-making in agricultural markets.
Details
Retail Sales Analytics and Forecasting Platform
This project develops a Power BI platform integrating Python and machine learning models (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM) to forecast sales, optimize inventory, and drive strategic decisions. It offers real-time dashboards, key KPIs (e.g., GMROI, sales velocity), and actionable insights, with scalability for diverse retail sectors. Stakeholder feedback has been incorporated, and the models are successfully deployed. Next steps include final integration, automation, and client delivery.
Details
Integration of Augmented Reality in Marketing Communication
This project introduces an AR-based marketing approach that replaces static ads with interactive, immersive experiences. Using tools like Unity and Vuforia, we developed a prototype that shows how AR boosts customer engagement and purchase intent. The goal is to launch an AR marketing agency that helps brands connect with audiences in innovative and impactful ways.

Namal Knowledge City
An Inspiration, A Dream
Developed nations across the world have relied on knowledge as the engine of growth. Throughout history knowledge cities like Oxford and Cambridge Universities have led to economic prosperity, technological breakthroughs, and cultural and social welfare. Even after hundreds of years these cities thrive with knowledge as foundation stone. Namal Knowledge City is an ambitious project that carries on this example of creating a knowledge economy in the heart of Pakistan.
It will be the first project of its kind in the country bringing together knowledge workers from all over the world to constitute one of Pakistan’s largest consortiums to acquire, create, disseminate, and utilize knowledge. A key feature will be the sustainable development of the knowledge city and communities in Pakistan at large.
Major construction work on the city is expected to be completed by the year 2027. The knowledge city will include academic blocks, libraries, technology parks, business centers, dairy farms, primary and secondary schools, sports facilities, a hospital, shopping centers, hotels, and housing colony for staff, faculty and students. By year 2023 the knowledge city will complete the first phase of its development whereby it will accommodate 800 students and 50 faculty members.

Integration and Verification of L1 Data Cache in SweRV EH1 RISC-V Core
23-May-2024
RISC-V, an open-source instruction set architecture, has characteristics of high performance, modularity and easy expansion, therefore, numerous numbers of open-source cores have been employed in academic and commercial projects within a few years. Caches significantly boost CPU performance by storing frequently used data closer to the processor to reduce memory latency. This paper details our contribution to open-source hardware: integrating a parameterized set-associative Level 1 data cache with a Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy into the SweRV EH1 core, a widely used 32-bit RISC-V core. Supporting cache with a write-through policy and analysis of the hit/miss rate upon CPU requests. Design verification is done via standard and open-source verification tools.

Office of the Registrar
Registrar’s office is the central, main and vital organ of the University. As the principal office, it liaisons with the external regulatory bodies and also coordinates among all the authorities and the Academic Departments of the University. This office is the custodian of the university common seal and organizes the meetings of the chartered bodies of the University.
Student Support Office (SSO)
The first and foremost contact for the Namal students is the Student Support Office (SSO) in the Registrar office. SSO was established from the start of the Namal University to provide facilitation to the students under one roof.
The SSO is mandated with a wide variety of tasks with respect to facilitation and guidance of students during their life at campus. It serves as an interface between students and faculty/staff members for academic, non-academic, financial and administrative issues. At times, students need some reference letter for internships or need their documents to get attested from the University. SSO is the first point of contact for all students to inquire about the course related issues like submission of assignments /course work, exam results, leave requests and approvals and academic extenuation requests etc. It provides the mechanism for mediation and advisory role for students involved in university disputes, appeal and disciplinary processes.
The main objectives of the office include:
Maintain up to date data of all students and share with respective departments.
Make sure the synchronization and safety of all students record.
