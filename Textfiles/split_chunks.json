    "content": "Fault diagnosis in photovoltaic (PV) arrays is essential in enhancing power output as well as the useful life span of a PV system. Severe faults such as Partial Shading (PS) and high impedance faults, low location mismatch, and the presence of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) make fault detection challenging in harsh environmental conditions. In this regard, there have been several attempts made by various researchers to identify PV array faults. However, most of the previous work has focused on fault detection and classification in only a few faulty scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes deep two-dimensional (2-D) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from 2-D scalograms generated from PV system data in order to effectively detect and classify PV system faults. An in-depth quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach is presented and compared with previous classification methods for PV array faults – both classical machine learning",

Unlike contemporary work, five different faulty cases (including faults in PS – on which no work has been done before in the machine learning domain) have been considered in our study, along with the incorporation of MPPT. We generate a consistent dataset over which to compare ours and previous approaches, to make for the first (to the best of our knowledge) comprehensive and meaningful comparative evaluation of fault diagnosis. It is observed that the proposed method involving fine-tuned pre-trained CNN outperforms existing techniques, achieving a high fault detection accuracy of 73.53%. Our study also highlights the importance of representative and discriminative features to classify faults (as opposed to the use of raw data), especially in the noisy scenario, where our method achieves the best performance of 70.45%. We believe that our work will serve",

Availability of quality higher education creates such opportunities. If we make higher education available and affordable for our talented youth, it will lay the foundation for a vibrant and growing society enabling us to stand amongst the leading nations. Namal University Mianwali is exactly that kind of equal opportunity for the marginalized rural youth. I am under no illusion that it is a huge challenge to set up a center of excellence in such a remote location.

Social media is the main and speediest source of fake news propagation, whereas online news websites contribute to fake news dissipation. In this study, we propose a framework to detect fake news using the temporal features of text and consider user feedback to determine whether the news is fake or not. In recent studies, the temporal features in text documents gain valuable consideration from Natural Language Processing and user feedback and only try to classify the textual data as fake or true. This research article indicates the impact of recurring and non-recurring events on fake and true news. We use different models such as LSTM, BERT, and CNN-BiLSTM to investigate, and it is concluded that from BERT, we get better results, and 70% of true news is recurring, and the rest of 30% is non-recurring.",

When an attacker acquires more than 50% of the hash power of the entire network, they gain the ability to engage in double-spending activities, posing a significant threat to the PoW consensus algorithm. This research focuses on the consensus algorithm employed in the Bitcoin system, explaining how it operates and the security challenges it faces. The proposed modification to the PoW algorithm imposes a restriction on miners: they are not allowed to accept consecutive blocks from the same miner into the final local blockchain to prevent the 51% attack problem. This modification supports transactions that require six confirmations. In the event an attacker attempts a 51% attack with a private chain that consists of fewer than 6 blocks, it becomes easier to detect a double-spending attack before accepting the attacker’s private chain.

This meticulous comparison aims to detect instances of double-spending. If such instances are detected, the miner rejects the attacker’s chain, establishing a double-spend-free environment and thwarting 51% attacks.",

TIR exploits the temporal dynamics in the information retrieval process and harnesses both textual relevance and temporal relevance to fulfill the temporal information requirements of a user Ur Rehman Khan et al., 2018. The focus time of document is an important temporal aspect which is defined as the time to which the content of the document refers Jatowt et al., 2015; Jatowt et al., 2013; Morbidoni et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2018. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any standard benchmark data set (publicly available) that holds the potential to comprehensively evaluate the performance of focus time assessment strategies. Considering these aspects, we have produced the Event-dataset, which is comprised of 35 queries and set of news articles for each query. Such that,  where C represents the dataset, is query set and for each  there is a set of news",

We believe that the generation of such dataset can provide an opportunity for the information retrieval researchers to use it as a benchmark to evaluate focus time assessment methods specifically and information retrieval methods generically.\nSection-based focus time estimation of news articles\n23-Nov-2018",

One of the important aspects of a news document is the focus time , a time to which the content of document refers. The contemporary state-of-the-art does not exploit focus time to retrieve relevant news document. This paper investigates the inverted pyramid news paradigm to determine the focus time of news documents by extracting temporal expressions, normalizing their value and assigning them a score on the basis of their position in the text. In this method, the news documents are first divided into three sections following the inverted pyramid news paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of four methods for splitting news document into sections: the paragraph-based method, the words-based method, the sentence-based method, and the semantic-based method (SeBM). Temporal expressions in each section are assigned weights using a linear regression",

Finally, a scoring function is used to calculate a temporal score for each time expression appearing in the document. These temporal expressions are then ranked on the basis of their temporal score, where the most suitable expression appears on top. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a diverse dataset of news related to popular events; the results revealed that the proposed splitting methods achieved an average error of less than 5.6 years, whereas the SeBM achieved a high precision score of 0.35 and 0.77 at positions 1 and 2, respectively.",

Web search engines like Google or Bing are common examples of IR systems. An important constituent of a search engine is news retrieval, where users present their information needs in the form of temporal queries. Users are usually interested in news documents focusing on a particular time period. Existing search engines rarely fulfill the temporal information requirements as they ignore the temporal information available in the content of news documents, also known as document focus time. Furthermore, information related to multiple time periods in a news document makes the identification of document focus time a challenging task. Therefore, it is necessary to classify news documents based on temporal specificity before it is possible to use the temporal information in the retrieval process. In this study, we formulate the temporal specificity problem as a time-based",

In this study, we formulate the temporal specificity problem as a time-based classification task by classifying news documents into three temporal classes, ie high temporal specificity, medium temporal specificity, and low temporal specificity. For such classification, rule-based and temporal specificity score (TSS)-based classification approaches are proposed. In the former approach, news documents are classified using a defined set of rules that are based on temporal features. The later approach classifies news documents based on a TSS score using the temporal features. The results of the proposed techniques are compared with four machine learning classification algorithms: Bayes net, support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree. The …",

On the other hand, the World Wide Web has unlimited resources of information in different languages which English native find challenging to understand. To avoid such barriers, Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems are proposed, which refers to document retrieval tasks across different languages. This work focuses on the performance evaluation of different Information Retrieval (IR) models in CLIR system using Quran dataset. Furthermore, this work also investigated the length of query and query expansion models for effective retrieval. The results show that different length of queries has an impact on the performance of the retrieval methods in terms of effectiveness. Hence, after comprehensive experiments, an appropriate length of query for Arabic CLIR system is suggested along with the best query expansion and retrieval model.",

Deep learning (DL) techniques have proved helpful in analysis and delineation of infectious regions in radiological images in a timely manner. This paper makes an in-depth survey of DL techniques and draws a taxonomy based on diagnostic strategies and learning approaches. DL techniques are systematically categorized into classification, segmentation, and multi-stage approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis at image and region level analysis. Each category includes pre-trained and custom-made Convolutional Neural Network architectures for detecting COVID-19 infection in radiographic imaging modalities; X-Ray, and Computer Tomography (CT). Furthermore, a discussion is made on challenges in developing diagnostic techniques in pandemic, cross-platform interoperability, and examining imaging",

These system applications are endangered by severe disruptions due to critical faults in power electronic switches, which can cause whole system shutdowns and component damage. To reduce these risks and ensure reliable operation under faulty conditions, a robust Fault-Tolerant Control System (FTCS) for TPMC is essential. This paper introduces the diagnosed open-circuit switches fault and fault-tolerant control for TPMCs. The Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) unit is recommended for integration with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based FTCS to identify and isolate defective switches. The FDI unit is additionally outfitted with Modified Triple Modular Redundancy (MTMR) to ensure fault tolerance.

These prosumer-based smart grids are facing the reliability issues that can be mitigated through the adoption of competitive storage technologies. A range of competitive storage technologies have been developed by scientists. However, the systematic selection of best storage technologies is still one of the main challenging research issues in the current literature. To fill this literature gap, this paper proposes a multi-criteria decision framework for energy storage selection in prosumer-based networks. First, a decision-making hierarchy was developed based on the three main criteria including energy flow management for prosumers, technical features, and sustainability. Under these criteria, various sub-criteria were identified. Second, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem was solved for two cases using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking",

Finally, a comprehensive outlook has been provided for prosumer energy storage evaluation. Findings revealed several implications for more accurate storage evaluation decision making. For instance, sensitivity analysis reveals that the lithium ion battery (LIB) has the first preference in AHP method, and the lead acid battery (LAB) has the first preference in PROMETHEE method. However, the second preference for AHP method was the LAB, and the second preference for PROMETHEE method was the LIB. Hence, separate application AHP and PROMETHEE offered a slightly different ranking. According to the proposed hybrid procedure, LIB was ranked as the first option by both AHP and PROMETHEE",

Storage evaluation decision making has several implications for prosumer-based power systems. In future, only a few storage alternatives would not meet the needs of the large scale emerging power systems, such as peer-to-peer networks. In this situation, the rapid and accurate ranking of various competitive storage alternatives would be a challenging problem. This study is valuable because it offers a comprehensive and flexible decision making tool for storage evaluation for prosumer-based smart grids. For instance, the proposed model can be evaluated with addition or removal of criteria and storage alternatives under different situations.",

Due to emerging of some control complexities, as well as the input limitations, time-varying delay, uncertainty, and external disturbance, such a tracking goal would be realized through suitable design of the composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) controller. Thus, considering the mentioned limitations, a Lyapunov-based procedure is used to determine the control law. Then, the parameters of the CNF input are derived by using the solution of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. The planned tracking idea is numerically implemented in two uncertain control systems. Some performance characteristics (i.e., the tracking error, boundedness, and transient responses) are compared with similar ones.

In this paper, using the impedance method, as well as a deep neural network, a new method for FL is suggested, which can provide a unique answer. In this approach, the FL is determined in less than 6 s, and the accuracy of 99 percent. The deep memory neural network is then used to accurately detect the exact fault location between candidate points. This method also identifies the line where the fault occurred.

Unfortunately, whether these solutions can be extended to Augmented Reality (AR) interactions has not been investigated before. In this paper, we investigate the perceptual differences between VR and AR environments with a user study experiment based on a stiffness discrimination task. Our findings revealed similar task accuracy and sensitivity in VR and AR but different exploration behaviors (i.e. higher interaction time in AR) and user experience (i.e. higher enjoyment and less mental fatigue in AR).\nConference Publications\nEnhancing Eye-Hand Coordination in Volleyball Players: A Comparative Analysis of VR, AR, and 2D Display Technologies and Task Instructions\n21-Oct-2024",

Although these studies suggested VR & AR EHCTSs as potential training systems for sports players, they recruited participants for their user studies among general population. In this paper, we examined the training performance of 16 professional volleyball players over 8 days using EHCTSs with three display technologies (VR, AR, and 2D touchscreen) and with four distinct task instructions (prioritizing speed, error rate, accuracy, or none). Our results indicate that volleyball players performed best with 2D touchscreen in terms of time, error rate, accuracy, precision, and throughput. Moreover, their performance was superior when using VR over AR.\nEye-hand coordination training: A systematic comparison of 2D, VR, and AR display technologies and task instructions",

In this paper, we compare user motor performance with an EHCT setup in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and on a 2D touchscreen display in a longitudinal study. Through a ten-day user study, we thoroughly analyzed the motor performance of twenty participants with five task instructions focusing on speed, error rate, accuracy, precision, and none. As a novel evaluation criterion, we also analyzed the participants’ performance in terms of effective throughput. The results showed that each task instruction has a different effect on one or more psychomotor characteristics of the trainee, which highlights the importance of personalized training programs.\nSustainable agriculture: an IoT-based solution for early disease detection in greenhouses\n09-Jun-2023",

In the agricultural context, smart devices are utilized to acquire and transmit data from a diverse range of sensors that monitor intricate environmental parameters crucial to ensuring optimal plant growth. These factors encompass but are not limited to humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and water pH. Continuous monitoring and control of these environmental aspects are essential for maximizing plant growth and yield. Manual disease monitoring is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise in plant pathology. To overcome these challenges, convolutional neural network models employing deep learning techniques have been developed to detect and diagnose diseases in plants.",

Such systems have already been tested in Virtual Reality, and the results revealed that Head Mounted Display-based systems have the potential to improve the motor training. However, this was only investigated in an hour-long study. In the longitudinal study reported here, we analyzed the motor performance of three participants in ten sessions with three different assessment criteria, where participants were instructed to focus on speed, error rate, or complete the training freely (with no instructions). We also assessed the effective throughput performance of the participants. Our results indicate that effective throughput can be potentially used as an additional assessment criterion. We hope that our results will help practitioners and developers design efficient Virtual Reality training systems.\nCourses\nVisiting Namal\n30 km Talagang Road, Mianwali, 42250, Pakistan",

The main focus of this research is to build a task-scheduling algorithm for a heterogeneous environment. We proposed an algorithm named parental prioritization earliest finish time. It has two phases, task prioritization phase and processor assigning phase. In the tasks prioritization phase, tasks will schedule in the parental priority queue (PPQ) on the basis of downward rank and parental priority. Task prioritization is based on the directed acyclic graph. It can schedule the task of successor row before the current row if it has less communication cost. In the processor assigning phase, the processor will allocate to the scheduled tasks obtained from PPQ keeping the computation cost to a minimum. This proposed algorithm is compared with HEFT and CPOP algorithms through graphs generated from a random task graph generator and a set of tasks. The experimental results",

    "content": "29-Jan-2021\nCloud computing is the backbone of the modern information technology industry. Due to the increase in internet usage, social media, and smart phones, a large amount of data is producing. Cloud datacenters can provide resources to handle this data. If data is not properly handled, it can cause overhead on cloud servers and can increase operational costs. Genetic algorithm is used to solve scheduling problem efficiently, but they take a lot of time to find an optimal solution. In this paper, we proposed Flexible Genetic Algorithm Operators (FGAO) for Task Scheduling in Cloud Datacenters. This algorithm changes crossover and mutation operators according to the quality of scheduling solutions. Instead of giving a fixed stopping criteria algorithm uses flexible crossover and mutation operators as a stopping criterion. Experimental results show that the proposed FGAO algorithm reduces 40% execution time and 33% iterations as compared to the genetic algorithm.\nCourses",

The class of 2026, as per our tradition, arranged an extraordinary farewell party/dinner for the outgoing class of 2025. The students of third year and the final year students showed an awesome bondage. The management won appreciation for arranging the exceptional and befitting farewell for the class 2025.

This is achieved through social account and work account which all students are required to maintain at the bank. All students of Namal University are require to contribute 320 hours every year towards community service. Examples of community service include collection of waste, tuition services for school going children, plantation drives in the community, etc. Students will need to deposit their hours in the social account. Students who are on scholarships are required to contribute additional hours for on-campus and off- campus jobs. The hours should be deposited in the work account. Maximum of\n320 hours per year",

Jobs in this category include working on projects related to renewable energy, waste recycling, management of farms (olive orchards, vegetable farms, etc.), and other projects given by partners and Founding Members of Namal. Another way of looking at Time Bank is to understand that students have a maximum of 960 hours which they need to deposit in the bank. These hours can be divided as follows; one-third to be spent on community service, one-third on on-campus and off-campus jobs, and remaining one-third (i.e.320 hours) can be deposited in the Alumni Scholarship Fund in terms of equivalent rupee value after graduation. Contribution in the Alumni Scholarship Fund is not mandatory. Through Time Bank all students are able to learn and polish themselves professionally while learning the six Namal values.

AIDS, cancer, neurologic disorders, and other clinical conditions can all be fatal due to retrovirus infections. Detection of retroviruses by genome sequence is a biological problem that benefits from computational methods. The National Center for Biotechnol-ogy Information (NCBI) promotes science and health by making biomedical and genomic data available to the public. This research aims to classify the different types of rotavirus genome sequences available at the NCBI. First, nucleotide pattern occurrences are counted in the given genome sequences at the preprocessing stage. Based on some significant results, the number of features used for classification is reduced to five. The classification shall be carried out in two phases. The first phase of classification shall select only two features. Unclassified data in the first phase is transferred to the next phase, where the",

The performance of the classifier is analyzed using the test data set. Also, we use decision tree, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and vector support machines to compare results. The results show that the proposed approach performs better than the existing methods for the retrovirus's imbalanced genome-sequence dataset.",

This study focuses on transfer learning with 3D U-Net models to classify ductal carcinoma, the most frequent subtype of breast cancer, in histopathology imaging. In this research work, a dataset of 162 microscopic images of breast cancer specimens is utilized for breast histopathology analysis. Preprocessing the original image data includes shrinking the images, standardizing the intensities, and extracting patches of size 50 × 50 pixels. The retrieved patches were employed to construct a basic 3D U-Net model and a refined 3D U-Net model that had been previously trained on an extensive medical image segmentation dataset. The findings revealed that the fine-tuned 3D U-Net model (97%) outperformed the simple 3D U-Net model (87%) in identifying ductal cancer in breast histopathology",

Several prosthetic control applications can benefit from the analysis based on the classification of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. However, for the real-time application of upper limb prosthesis, the EMG-based systems need robust performance and rapid response behavior. In this study, we propose an efficient concatenated convolutional neural network (E2CNN) for classification of sEMG extracted from the upper limb. We have tested and validated the performance of the proposed E2CNN on two datasets: a longitudinal dataset comprising ten nondisabled (healthy) subjects and six transradial amputee subjects and spanning the data collected for a period of seven days; and the publicly available NinaPro DB1 dataset.

For over a century the dam has served as a constant source of precious water for the farmers in the area.

Despite early obstacles, Namal College was established in 2008 with the support of the local community and generous donors. The initial 5 acres (40 kanals) of land for this college was provided by Ghulam Muhammad Seelu, a local resident of village Namal. Namal College started its operations with one degree program as an affiliate college of the University of Bradford, UK. In early 2019, Namal was granted degree-awarding status and became Namal Institute.",

Quest for novel hydrophobic materials compatible to oil for enhanced recovery using electromagnetic is the major focus in this field. In the present study, we present ZnO-MWCNT nanocomposite prepared using sol-gel technique for the application of enhanced oil recovery. XRD analysis shows that average particle size in the range of 30-39 nm. Morphology analysis showed that ZnO are coated on the surface of the MWCNT. Vibrational analysis indicated that ZnO-MWCNT nanocomposite exhibited E2 (high) mode of ZnO and G (sp2 carbon) bands of MWCNTs and intense sharp peak of Zn-O stretching bond. A 11.11% of oil recovery was observed using ZnO-MWCNT composite nanofluid. This recovery further enhanced to 16.10% under the effect of electromagnetic field. Therefore, this novel material can be used to enhance oil recovery with application of EM waves. [Received: September 7, 2017; Accepted: March 28, 2018]",

Results demonstrated that gas interactions with carbon nanotubes increased as the mole ratio of carbon dioxide increased in H2, N2 and CO2 mixture, conversely decreased for NH3 and CO2 mixture. After increasing CO2 mole fraction from 1/5 to 1/3 for hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide mixture, adsorption energy and rate on carbon nanotube atoms increased by 45 and 33%, respectively, due to a 59% increase in van der Waal interactions.

To address these challenges, research has investigated the potential use of biochar in low-fertility and degraded soils to increase soil fertility, nutrient uptake, and water retention, ultimately improving soil productivity and crop growth. A field study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of biochar, coupled with chemical nutrient on the availability of soil nutrient and crop growth. The evaluations comprised measurements of CEC of soil, pH levels of soil, soil bulk density, total nitrogen (N), soil phosphorus (P), SOM, soil texture, extractable potassium (K), and total organic carbon (TOC). Nitrogen fixation by mash beans was also evaluated using xylem solute techniques. This study’s results will contribute valuable insights into the impact of biochar on crop growth and soil health in rain-fed regions.",

His suspended poetry communicates about broad vision, wisdom and intellectuals. Iqbal wrote poetry to save the youth and Muslim of sub-continent from destruction, miserable condition, and low mental state of the people. According to Iqbal wrong mental nurturing is gigantic and more serious mistake than the wrong political progress. A nation goes down when a nation ignores aims, culture and civilization, moral and cultural values, and religious ethics. Iqbal says a nation can progress on the basis of \"broad vision\". Iqbal always compare broad vision and intellectualism in terms of Quran education. It is also a fact only those nations can be destroyed who made the foundation of their thinking, vision, progress and prosperity only on their religion. A nation can't be demolished who remain determined positively on their religious values.",

It is the color of true love and boundless devotion to God. The summation of Iqbal's poetry is Love of Rasool(S.A.W) and Obedience of Rasool. From the study of Iqbal's speech, this fact is clearly revealed that he considers the Holy Prophet to be the source of all external and internal perfections and the source of all reality and authority. According to Allama Iqbal, love of Prophet (P.B.U.H) is the dear possession without which a person can neither live in the world nor gain anything from religion.\nHUMAN MORAL VALUES AND IQBAL THOUGHT\n31-Dec-2020",

In the Agricultural sector in Pakistan, Livestock comprises a major part. Unfortunately, at many levels, multiple animals are considered un-identified because their breed is not recognized properly. For a long time, the animal breeds are recognized manually just by using previous knowledge. DNA imprinting methods that include studying the types of animals by studying their Genome sequence is another popular strategy but is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, a cost-effective and easy-to-use method is required for proper breed recognition. In this project, we are proposing the recognition of the breed of livestock by developing a deep-learning model using the image data.

Caches significantly boost CPU performance by storing frequently used data closer to the processor to reduce memory latency. This paper details our contribution to open-source hardware: integrating a parameterized set-associative Level 1 data cache with a Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy into the SweRV EH1 core, a widely used 32-bit RISC-V core. Supporting cache with a write-through policy and analysis of the hit/miss rate upon CPU requests. Design verification is done via standard and open-source verification tools.\nCourses\nComputer Architecture\nObject Oriented Programming\nApplication of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)",
